 INTRODUCTION Short overview of the agricultural and political background 1750-1850
"In the middle of the eighteenth century agriculture in Ireland was very backward and tillage played a subservient role to grazing. This was further aggravated by the system of land tenure. In the late 18"" century, most of the land in Ireland was in the hands of the landed gentry. The estates were normally managed by the landlords agents who were responsible for renting most of the land to middlemen, large - farmers, smaller farmers and cottiers. In general, the farmers produced grain which they gave to the landlord in lieu of the rent. Potatoes, milk, beef, poultry and pork were sold or used on farm. Currency, as we know it to-day, was not in normal use by farmers or labourers. The very small farmers produced only potatoes and pigs. The pigs in this situation were used to pay the landlord. Without potatoes they could not feed themselves or the pigs and therefore could not pay the rent."
"According to the 1841 census there were a total of 695,309 farms in Ireland of which 45% were under 5 acres and only 7% over 30 acres."
"Contrary to public opinion, it appears from the Gazette that most of the landlords ©"
"were not “absentee landlords” and only a few, whether absentee or otherwise were “pad” landlords. The fact that nearly ail landlords were anglo-saxon and protestant would not have helped their public profile or endeared them to their catholic tenants. It is highly probable that the current day “landlords” are as bad as those during the famine period, except on a much smaller scale. The famine resulted in rents not being paid while at the same time the cost of providing relief fell largely on the landlord. This eventually lead to the bankruptcy of many landlords and the eventual redistribution of land in Ireland."
"In 1758 the Irish Parliament made its first real effort to promote tillage. In this year the first bounties were granted for the inland carriage of corn to Dublin, and this seems to have had some effect in checking the influx of British corn into Ireland. In 1767, a small bounty was given by the Irish Parliament on the carriage of Irish corn by sea to Dublin. This further promoted tillage in Ireland. At the same time the English population was rising due to the industrial revolution with a consequent increase in the demand for grain which was accompanied by a decline in exports from the UK, Towards the end of the 18"" century ‘Fosters Corn Laws’ were passed and much attention was focussed on the promotion of tillage. The Corn Laws effectively protected the United Kingdom growers from cheap imports and also guaranteed a minimum price for home produced grain."
"The Act of Union (1801) meant that Ireland was part of the United Kingdom from that time. The Napoleonic wars of 1793-1815 also increased the demand for grain. Corn mills sprung up all over the country and the export of corn to England became increasingly profitable to all classes connected with agriculture. The Torys were in power at the time and their grain policy resulted in higher prices for bread. This was in the height of the industrial revolution and the high price for bread resulted in the workers demanding higher wages. This did not suit the industrialists and the Corn Laws were eventually repealed in 1846. However, the export of grain from Ireland continued for many years after the repeal of the Corn Laws. One of the reasons for"
CQ  this was that grain was used to pay the rent to the landlord and the main outlet for this grain was the export trade to England. Ireland became known as the breadbasket of England.
"At the start of the famine the Prime Minister was Sir Robert Peel and the government's chief representative in Ireland was the Lord Lieutenant, Baron William B. Heyetsbury. In December 1845 Sir Robert Peel was replaced by Lord John Russell. The Lord Lieutenant for Ireland at the end of the above period was the Ear! of Bessborough (family name Ponsonby). His family home was in Piltown, Co. Kilkenny and the currently (2011) occupied by Teagasc as horticultural college."
"The area under potatoes increased annually up to the time of the famine when there were some 2 million acres which provided an abundant supply of cheap and easily grown food. This, normally dependable food source, supported an ever increasing population which reached some 8 million by the time of the great famine. This lead to an over-dependence on the potato crop and a major failure of this crop would lead to hardship, famine and disease. Some referred to this as a “disaster waiting to happen’."
The great famine (1845-1849) resulted in the death from hunger and disease of some one million Irish people while a further two million emigrated.
The Carlow Connection
"I spent all of my working life (1964-2008) engaged in potato research at Oak Park Research Centre in Carlow. As much of this period was devoted to research on different aspects of late blight and it’s control, it was very natural to take an interest in the famine period, especially from a pathological prospective. A major scientific conference entitled “Phytophthora 150”, was organised by the European Association of Potato Research in 1995 to mark the 150"" anniversary of the first outbreak of late blight in Ireland. The conference covered all aspects of research on Phytophthora infestans, including the scientific controversy of the famine period."
"At the time of the conference there were some missing details and some disputed facts which appeared would never be resolved. Imagine my surprise and excitement when recently, an old rugby friend, Mr. Tom Corrigan of Castledermot, Co. Kildare, presented me with bound editions of the Farmers Gazette from 1844 to 1847 which he had picked up at an auction."
What was the Farmers Gazette?
"The Farmers Gazette and Journal of Practical Horticulture was an important and influential periodical, published at 23 Bachelors Walk, Dublin every Saturday prior to and during the period of the great famine. It seemd to be the equivalent of the present day /rish Farmers Journal. It dealt with all aspects of agriculture and horticulture, and was especially interested in the improvement of agriculture through the use of scientific information such as it was at the time. Given the absence of modern means of communication at the time of the famine, it is extraordinary how well informed people were of what was going on, not alone in Ireland, but also in the rest of the British Isles as well as Europe and America. It regularly reported on the meetings of learned societies in Ireland as well as other parts of the United Kingdom,  Europe and North America."
"At home, the Gazette regularly reported the proceedings of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland, the Royal Dublin Society, the Dublin Natural History Society as well as the many local agricultural societies, farmers clubs and agricultural shows. It is true that the control and membership of the above societies were largely in the hands of the landlords and local gentry. Never the less, the Gazette appeared to have a very genuine interest in improving agriculture for the benefit of both the landlord and tenant. The Gazette constantly reminds us that the main constraint in achieving this improvement in Ireland was the lack of capital for agriculture at that time."
"The many references to the potato, confirm the importance of the crop to Irish agriculture at the time, and emphasises the interest in its development and well being taken by everybody, from the nobility to the labourer. lts pages are full of advice and practical experience relating to all aspects of the growth and development of the crop. The frequent references to failures and diseases of the crop highlight the importance of these aspects to the nation as a whole."
References to Potato Diseases Prior to Late Blight
"While the discipline of Plant Pathology was unknown in the 1840's, the effect of diseases such as smut, bunt, rust and ergot in cereals was well known and certain control measures were applied."
"In the potato, the main diseases prior to the famine were potato leaf roll virus (Curl), black-leg and dry-rot (Taint). Each of these diseases caused problems from time to time and did result in partial or complete failures of the crop in certain areas. No seed certification schemes were in existence at this time, but an accidental cure for the curl was found in the growing of potatoes from true seed rather than tubers. This was in part responsible for the proliferation of new potato varieties at this time."
"In the period leading up to the famine the main disease referred to in the Gazette appeared to be dry-rot (Fusarium caeruleum). The main effect of this disease was to cause failures in emergence, but, there were also significant losses during storage. The disease was not confined to Ireland and it was prevalent in the UK and the rest of Europe. A huge number of articles and letters appeared in the Gazette suggesting ways of reducing the losses from dry rot. All of the potato varieties grown in Europe at the time seemed to be very susceptible to infection with this disease. Ironically, it seems to be in the search for resistant germplasm, that late blight infected tubers were first introduced to Europe from the USA."
"A total of 284 articles on potatoes have been scanned and are included below; 27 are from 1844, 117 from 1845, 104 from 1846 and 36 from 1847. Most of the many articles on a substitute for the potato have been left out as they have little or no baring on the disease itself. The many articles on the potato confirm the importance of the crop at the time in Ireland."
"However, after two consecutive and general failures of the potato (1845 & 1846), there seemed to be a depth of feeling building up against the potato, especially as"
"oO  the sole source of food for so many. This led to a major debate as to what would fill its place, The big problem was to find a replacement that would produce enough food without dramatically increasing the area required as this would only add to the rents paid by the tenants."
"One of the surprising discoveries from the Gazette was the relatively common practice of planting a winter potato crop between November and January. The large area of potatoes, coupled with winter, spring and summer planting would have ensured that there was foliage available for infection with late blight over a much longer period than at present."
Records of the Late Blight Disease in the Gazette
"The first reference to late blight appears in the Farmers Gazette, on Saturday, September 13, 1845 when the editorial stated “The potato crop, so far as our observations extend, is very fine, and entirely free from the dreadful disease which has committed such havoc in the potato fields of Belgium, Holland and the south of England. Rumours of the disease having broken out in several fields in Ireland, have reached us, but as yet it cannot be said that the plague is not at all prevalent’."
"However, in the same issue the following letter also appeared - “Sir — There is in this neighbourhood a very large field of potatoes, which has had a very fine appearance until within the last fortnight, when suddenly they commenced to fade, and get quite rotten, continuing to get worse every day. They are of the Cup and Lumper kind. The field was oat stubble last year, the land dry and gravelly. We put on about eighty cart loads of farmyard manure per acre. They were planted the in third week in April, part in ridges and part in drills; and continued to hold a healthy appearance until the period they were first noticed to fade all at once; when the stalk lost is healthy colour, and the potatoes became tainted, commencing at the root. I write the foregoing account, hoping that you, or some of your numerous correspondents, may be able to assign a cause, and, perhaps, prescribe a remedy for any such evil in the future. — Yours, &c., A. S. N., Castlebellingham, 9"" Sept., 1845,."
"This would confirm that the disease had made its first appearance in the north Leinster area, some time in the latter half of August 1845."
"It is a coincidence that the first observation of resistance to the fungicide Metalaxyl was in the same general area in 1980, some 135 years later. A tour of the area around Kilberry Cross, near Navan, in August 1980 reminded me very much of what might have been a common experience at the time of the famine."
"A number of concerned citizens, including myself, met to look at a few blight control problems in the area. The first few fields were almost totally defoliated. As we moved from field to field the situation did not improve, but the entourage became bigger and bigger until some 100 bewildered and angry farmers had gathered. All were looking for an explanation. The explanation was obvious but could not be proffered at that time until I had scientific evidence. The gathering eventually proceeded to the pub at Kilberry Cross for refreshments and further discussion. Following a liberal intake of alcohol, the mood of the “discussion group” became decidedly militant and began to  demand compensation and blood. At this point, discretion was the better part of valour, and I discreetly slipped away under the cover of darkness."
Attempts to Identify the Cause of the Problem
"Many suggestions were put forward as the cause of the new malady. These included lightning, electricity, atmospheric conditions, intense heat, rain, lack of sunshine, fog, dung and guano,"
"The first reference in the Gazetfe to a fungal cause was in a letter from J. E. Teschemacher of Boston on February 1, 1845 referring to the disease in the USA the previous year. Thereafter, there were many references to a fungal cause by such people as Carroll, Hamilton, Garden, Kane, Lindlay, Playfair, Godsie, Macklin, Carlyon, Moore and Berkeley among others. However of these, only Berkeley ‘remained a firm advocate of the fungal theory. The remainder were of the opinion that the fungi were the result of the disease and not the cause. Part of the problem may have been the almost complete concentration on the infected tuber to the exclusion of the symptoms on the foliage."
"Much has been written about a scientific controversy in terms of the cause of the disease. However, it appears from the Gazette that while there were many theories on the cause of the new disease, to call it a “scientific controversy” might be somewhat overstating the case."
Quantification of the Disease
"One of the first organisations to react to the new disease was the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland when at their meeting on September 18"" 1845, the secretary was directed to prepare a circular letter to be sent to the secretaries of the farming bodies, requesting them to furnish the necessary information on the subject, respecting the prevalence or existence of the disease in their several districts, and all the particulars connected with it, in order that the fullest and most accurate information may be procured upon the subject. This was a very prompt response when it is considered that the problem was scarcely a month in existence in Ireland"
"A Commission was also set up by the Government to enquire into the disease. This Commission consisted of Sir Robert Kane (Chairman) and he was joined by Professors Lindlay and Playfair. While the commission produced some useful and lengthy reports, their work was seriously criticised by many, including the Gazette. Much of the criticism centred around the fact that the Commission was made up exclusively of scientists and lacked an input from agriculturalists with practical experience. It may be as a result of this criticism that their utterances on the potato problem seemed to die out as the famine intensified."
Some of the Potato Varieties Mentioned
"Irish Apple, Cups, Lumpers or Horse Potato, Victoria, Pink Eyed, Purple Eyed Americans, The Peeler, The Scotch Grey, The Scotch Whites, The White Rounds, The Long Blacks, White Kidneys, Purple Kidneys, Coppers, Black Bulls, Black Minion or Crow Potato, Rohan, Ash-Leaf Kidney, Adelphi Early, Cork Reds, Early"
"Co  Pink-eye, Fox’s Seedling, Bangors, Ladyfingers, Yellow Legs, Quarry’s, Sodan’s Early Frame, Early Shaws, Early Oxford, Prince Regent, Early Gravesend,"
The Visitation of God
"The Gospel according to Luke (21:5-19) mentions “There will be great earthquakes and plagues and famines here and there; there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven”. With statements like this from the bible, it is not surprising that some people would believe that the famine was sent by God to punish the Irish people."
"Leslie J. Dowley, January 2011.  CAUSE OF FAILURE IN THE POTATO Farmers Gazette, May 44%, 1844, page 23"
"A correspondent of the Warder enumerates very properly, we think, the following amongst the fruitful causes of failures in this important crop :—"
"Planting at a late season, when the potato is comparatively exhausted by previous dis-buddings; secondly, having the potatoes long cut before being planted; thirdly, permitting them to lie long uncovered after being dropped, either upon the ridge or in the drill, exposed to the action of the atmosphere, and under (it may be) the scorching rays of a summer's sun; fourthly, planting from potatoes which have previously exhibited symptoms of failure, or a weak and sickly aspect; fifthly, planting the same kind of potatoes successively upon the same farm; sixthly, rough treatment in raising, pitting, removing, turning, &c; seventhly, badly prepared ground and rough strawy manure; having the drills long made and the manure long spread before the potatoes are planted, which is very frequently the case, and which is a very bad practice; for, in the first instance, the very essence of the dung effects its escape through different mediums, and is robbed of the chief elements of fertility, or food of plants, and becomes dry and sapless; and the outside or exterior (which after- wards becomes the interior) part of the drills is so completely divested of moisture, at least during dry weather that “when (the potatoes are dropped upon dry sapless dung, and the sets, perhaps, lying uncovered for half a day, more or less) the drills are reversed, the dry or exterior part comes in immediate contact with the dry manure—and, it may be, dry and comparatively exhausted potatoes—ihat it is hard to expect success under such cir- cumstances."
"CURLIN POTATOES Farmers Gazette, May 18'"", 1844, page 37"
"Dr. Macdonald then read a paper by Mr. Bobert Boyd, Innerleithen, Peebles- shire, on the prevention of the curl in the potato, and on the best method of keeping potatoes intended for seed. Mr. Boyd says that he has been more troubled with the curl in the potato than with any other disease to which the plant is liable. For ten years a portion of his garden invariably produced curled potatoes, though the seed was annually changed, and not unfrequently the manure itself. On examining the tubers of the curled plants, he invariably found them affected with the wire-worm, or a small slug or snail, and although he dusted the sets with quicklime, not a single not a single plant was produced free of curl. He next dipped the sets in a mixture of salt and water, and dusted them with quicklime,and though the crop fell short of average, it was nearly double that produced by the sets not dipped in the saline solution. Next year, on the sets beind dipped in a solution of lime, salt and water, gave a satisfactory result, both in regard of freeness of disease and extent of produce. As to keeping of potatoes for seed, Mr. Boyd tried the planting of potatoes which had unintentionally been left in the field all winter in comparison with those which had been pitted in the usual way, the seed, the soil, the manure being alike, and the result was, that the plants from the sets which had"
"O  been left in the soil all winter were hoed, before those from the pitted potatoes appeared above ground, and they also ripened fourteen days earlier, and produced nearly a fourth part more of crop. In consequence of this result, Mr. Boyd left some potatoes in the drill all the winter, which he intended for seed, only protected from the frost by a little rough dung sprinkled upon the ground; and he also made a pit of about four feet in diameter of the same kind of potato which had been left in the drill, the pit consisting of a layer of potatoes and one of earth alternately, and covered in the usual way. In the spring of 1841, the potatoes in the pit seemed well preserved, though not so juicy as those left in the drills. On both being planted, the sets from the drills germinated some days earlier, were sooner ripe, and produced a heavier crop, though those from the earthy pits gave a superior crop to those pitted in the usual way. Latterly, Mr. Boyd tried keeping his seed potatoes in trenches six inches deep, strewed with salt and covered with rough dung. The potatoes were taken out fresh and unsprouted in the spring, and the _plants from them were equal to those raised from seed kept in the drill all the winter. Mr. Boyd mentions an interesting result obtained by using saw-dust and coal-ashes as manure to potatoes, and raising there from a crop of 20 bolls from three-eighths of an acre."
GOOD EFFECTS OF DEPRIVING THE POTATO PLANT OF ITS BLOSSOM
"Farmers Gazette, July 6°"", 1844, pages 154-155"
"SIR—Perhaps it may be of some importance to call’ attention to the following circumstance, especially at this season, when such an extensive failure has taken place in the potato crop."
"My potato garden of last season, was divided by the avenue, two-thirds on one side, and one-third on the other. I commenced pulling off the blossoms from this one-third, intending to do so to the whole field, it being a favourite theory with me,- that the blossom weakens the tuber, but I did not do more than this third, merely because people said it was so useless, and also indeed because it spoiled the blooming beauty of the field."
"This third was planted in the middle of April, the remainder towards the end of that month. Those from which the blossoms were pulled were much more productive, and that produce very superior, in quality and appearance to the other portion of the field."
"Being very particular in the selection of my seed, I had them sorted as usual, when drawing home in winter, into separate pits; those for seed being put in small pits, two feet wide, and those for sale or consumption in pits five or six feet wide. The seed put in the small pits for seed were selected from the two-thirds sown in the end of April, as I always heard it recommended to use !""e late rather than the early seed: this sorting, remember then, were from the potatoes from which no blossoms were pulled last season."
"This season we commenced planting on the 20th of April, from the seed so selected and  pitted in the small pits; but as tbe seed ran short, we opened the large, six feet wide, and sowed nearly as much more; the only difference beside the seed was, that what was allowed to blossom last season had fine well-rotted, well-prepared dung, while the latter got manure recently gathered from the yard, fresh. and strawy; the difference now, however, is very .great - those from which the blossoms were taken, having come up stronger, and far outstripped the others, although from the manure find care taken, the others are almost the very best in the neighbourhood: there are some failures, but not from the unblossomed seed, which even when accidentally cut with the spade and bruised with the wheel, yet remained perfectly sound, but this can not be said of the others."
"In a few places where the seed of the unblossomed ones happened to be displaced, and left on the surface of the drill, exposed to the great drought of this season, it grew and took root, sending down fibres round the set into the ground, but the others wherever displaced, shriveled up and decayed."
"Thus I am convinced that good sound seed will not be injured or prevented from growing by almost.any neglect; while tainted seed, be it ever so sound in appearance, can .scarcely be kept alive even with the greatest care."
"Where great care in planting and manuring has been taken, and yet the crop grows slowly, it is an evidence that the seed was not the soundest, and that but for the care taken they would not have grown at all. To the weakness of the seed all failures may be traced; and, therefore, to grow and preserve the seed should be the chief concern in potato culture. So fur for the practical result; and in theory, I believe botanists would advise, that to pull off the bloom will add to the tubers below; and that it adds to the quality and soundness, the above result fully satisfies me."
"You are aware of annuals being kept alive for two, three, or more years, by depriving them.of the bloom as it appears: the above sort of potato dose not generally bear berries ; still if keepin the blossoms off prolongs the existence of the plants, as it did with me this season, they will, of course, during the growing season, be adding to the quantity and quality of the tubers below; for of two objects to be attained by a plant, that of bearing seed above and ripening tubers below, it will surely do one much more perfect if its energy be confined to it. . :"
"Some writers affirm that excessive seed-bearing produces the curl in potatoes, and instances like effects in the animal kingdom. It is remarked, also, that in dry seasons bulbous and tuberous roots are more apt to bear seed; and perhaps it were well if some persons would take the trouble to look back and see if the failure in potatoes did not generally follow previous dry summers. This being a dry summer, if the above remarks contain any truth, it were well if people would devote some attention this wav, and give employment to many poor children; and indeed if the matter be of the importance that I think it is to the country at large, the committee of the Irish Agricultural Improvement Society ought to be directed this year to try the experiment on a large scale. I am so prejudiced in favour of it that 4 do not intend to try the experiment myself, but will destroy all the"

"THE FAILURE OF THE POTATO CROP Farmers Gazette, July 13%, 1844, page 170"
"Sir - As several articles on the cultivation of the potato appeared in your valuable GATETTE, and in the Gardiners Chronicle, I take the liberty to send you the few following remarks on the same subject, which cannot be too much discussed; and although no real specific to prevent failure has been given, yet if those who take an interest (and who has not) in the subject were to bring forward their experience, rnuch might be done to prevent failure, and ensure a fair crop in any season. This dry season has been the occasion of great loss in the potato crop in the neighbourhood, and I believe it general, and how could it be otherwise, for one might as well expect potatoes to grow after they had been done in an oven for dinner, as to plant them on manure which had been left on the field lying in heaps, or spread in the drills for several days, exposed to the sun and weather till it was as dry as dust before it was covered in, which is not infrequently the case. For nearly twenty years I have been in the habit of planting both early and late crops of potatoes, and in the later I never had a failure, although in early crops I have had some partial failures, owing to having been planted in old garden ground, where grubs and slugs destroyed the sets before they vegetated: but this can be greatly obviated by having some fresh-slaked lime worked into the soil when planting. In preparing ground for late crops, if after a grain crop, which is generally the case, it should be deeply ploughed in the autumn, and again in the spring, to be ploughed and harrowed as often as found necessary to bring it to a fine tilth, and all weeds collected and carted off to some convenient place for making manure. I consider from the middle of April to the middle of May the best time for planting; and with respect to choice of seed I have always found a good sound potato to grow when it got a fair chance. I do not approve of cutting the sets very small; a middle-sized potato may be cut into two, and a large one into three or four sets, two or three days before they are planted. The cause of failure is very often ascribed to the seed, which, no doubt, should be attributed to other causes. I always plant below the manure, which should be pretty well rotted before being used. The drills I always make three feet apart, which, if in dry ground, should run as nearly south and north as convenient, so that the sun may have equal influence on both sides of the drills ; but should the ground be wet, or of a moist nature, the drills should run with the greatest slope of the surface, to carry off the superabundant moisture that might collect from rain or any other cause. In planting, as much of the work as is begun in one day should be finished before night ; that is, opening the drills, manuring, planting, and covering in, should all be finished, that no open drills or manure be exposed to the weather during night, and perhaps to-morrow might be a bad day; just before the plants come up the drills should be lightly harrowed, and the plough or horse-hoe used between the drills, to destroy seed-weeds and freshen the soil, this breaks the crust and encourages vegetation; but in hoeing and cleaning after the plants are come up, I am no advocate for reducing the drills but as little as possible—to cut or disturb the young roots, or bare the stem below the level which is come through the ground, gives the tender and succulent plant a cheek which requires some time to recover. I may here observe that I deem it of considerable consequence to plant"
"10  below the manure, especially in a dry season, as the manure keeps the set cool and moist; and as the stem rises through the manure, it emits a tuft of roots at every eye or bud, which are quite at home in the cool dung, arid are immediately at .work, catering nourishment for the stem, enabling it to come up in greater strength and vigour than when planted on the manure. In earthing up I do not consider it necessary to raise more than about one inch of fresh earth about the stems, and not to bring i the drill to an acute angle, but leave a 'small channel . along the top of the drill to collect moisture for the roots, j unless in wet ground or a wet season, when it might be an advantage to throw off the rain into the furrows. Picking off all the flowers is strongly recommended in the Gardeners’ Chronicle: this I have done some years ago, but did not test the result with neighbouring drills, where the blossoms had not been picked off; however it is reasonable to think that it must be beneficial, when we consider the great weight of matter which goes to produce the enormous weight of apples which are often produced upon an acre of ground, but this I intend to put to the test here this season. As the potatoes can be transplanted readily, I cannot see how a good deal might not be done in making up blanks when there is only a partial failure, by wherever there is more than one stem rising from a set, to remove a little of the earth from one side, and slip off carefully all the stems but one, replace the earth again, and plant the stems in the nearest vacancy, about the same depth that they were before; and if done in a dull day, when the ground is moist, and the plant about two inches high, I have no doubt they would succeed very well.—Yours, &c., - James Alexander, Heath Farm, Athy, July 6"" 1844"
"POTATO FAILURES Farmers Gazette, August 31°', 1844, page 296"
"IN last, week's paper we had the pleasure to copy from a Scottish cotemporary a report, amongst other matters, of the highly interesting discussion which took place at one of the forenoon meetings of the Scottish Agricultural Chemistry Association, in Glasgow, on the subject of potato failures. This meeting had been announced for some time, some very eminent agriculturists attended it, and nothing can batter show the exceeding difficulty of the question mooted—viz., What is the cause of the potato failures, and is there a remedy for them ?—than the discrepancy of opinion advanced on the occasion. The general opinion of scientific agriculturists appears to be, that there is a liability inherent in every plant which has for a long period been cultivated in the same soil to become deteriorated, hence the universal belief in the advantage of "" changing the seed ;"" and that, in the case of the potato, the most likely means of avoiding failure would be, to procure a new generation of plants from seed (not tubers) of a healthy crop; but in the discussion to which we are referring, Mr. Girdwood's experience gave the death-blow, in limine, to this cherished opinion—the seedlings (whether raised from a healthy or tainted crop is not stated, however) were found to be as liable to decay as any others."
"Plant your potatoes whole, and in the autumn, use only such seed as have the eyes plump, protect from frost, and, says Theory, you will have no failures; not so fast, says Mr. Burnet, of Gadgirth, I have done all this, and still have experienced failures. Mr. Alexander, of Southbar, had never witnessed a failure in early-"
")  planted potatoes; how many within a few miles of Dublin, would give a great deal to be able to say the same truly, why early-planted potatoes are the most liable to failure; and as to this gentleman's other statement, that the failure of potatoes is traceable to some ill-treatment, especially by storing them in large masses, did it not occur to him that, up to 1832, no failures were caused by such treatment !. Mr. Allison, of Mears, stated, that potatoes taken from those, which for two seasons, had not been cut, would not fail, is, we fear mere assertation; whole potatoes, although net so liable to failure, we believe, as cut ones, still, it is notorious, do fail. Mr. Anderson, from the north of Ireland, as appears from his statement, has been. most successful in his efforts to avoid failures; and the means he adopts, viz., liming the ground, planting only in drained land, pulverizing the soil well, and not leaving either the manure or seed exposed to the effect of the sun and wind, are based on sound practical knowledge: his experience, however, that potatoes which have been prevented from blossoming are not less liable to fail (if that were his meaning), does not accord with that of some of our correspondents; nor with that of others, if it be that potatoes so divested do not yield larger crops. Mr. Anderson's experience, however—if he be, as we suspect he is, the excellent and practical land-agent of Sir Robert Fergusson, bart.,—at least since the commencement of the potato failures, has been in a mountain district; where, it is well known, potatoes are not so liable to fail as in lowlands."
"The successful practice of Mr. Reid, as mentioned by Sir Robert Bateson, Bart., of raising potatoes intended for seed before they are quite ripe, and leaving them on the ground to be dried in the sun, although Professor Johnston declared that he had never heard of it, is known and practised successfully by almost every gardener with his ash-leaved kidneys intended for forcing. And as to Mr. Fleming's experience—that the cup potato does not fail—we can only say, that such is not the experience of the farmers of this country."
"This discussion was, in fact, an epitome of the innumerable essays which for the last twelve years have appeared on the subject of potato failures; and which may be resolved into this, that we are utterly ignorant of the of these failures, and that our only chance of avoiding them is to use mountain-grown — which often means unripened — seed, which has been preserved from heating in narrow pits — to plant in dry, deep soil, at a moist time, using moist manure, and not permitting the sets to lie exposed - even for a few minutes - to the parching effects of sun, or harsh wind. - Editor"

"SIR - In page 272, on the failures in the potato crop I quite agree with Mr. Alexander's remarks, and to the following is a further proof of the correctness of observations, as to the land, being moist, so as to bring i the latent seeds of vegetation. A farmer in this neighbourhood for some years, and with great success, I adopted the following plan:—If the season be very d he has the"
"12  manure well watered before any of it is put i the drills; this causes a great moisture to the earth the drills, no time being lost in getting the potatoes and closing them up: This year he has a most abundant crop, and his neighbours a complete failure, when I manure was dry when put into the drills; where mold"
"_ and manure have been used together for potatoes, they have answered well this season, and for this reason, mold when deposited in the earth, produces a moisture similar to salt when it dissolves in the earth, or by dampness, might mention many other facts to bear out Mr. A. observations, but I think I have stated quite sufficient induce others to have their manure moist when planting their potatoes, or for putting into turnip-drills. I am,"
"Yours, &c., M. Sach, Fort Green Cottage, August 26, 1844"
"POTATO FAILURES Farmers Gazette, September 7"", 1844, page 314"
"SiR - The cause of the failure in the potato, as you observe in last week's remarks on the meeting of the Scottish Agricultural Chemistry Association, lately held in Glasgow, appears to be as yet a secret. Of the immediate effect, however, of that cause, there seems to be room for little diversity of opinion. The nearest cause to which we can trace the failure, though evidently no more than a secondary one, appears’ to be a lack of moisture or juices in the seed, eventuating in dry rot, immediately after being committed to the ground. As proof of this, a coarse or green tuber seldom refuses to grow, even when cut and planted early, or indeed at any time as far as my experience or accurate information has hitherto extended; while, on the other hand, such as are dry or mealy are apt not to grow luxuriantly, and often not at all, if cut and planted in dry weather, or late in the season."
"Now, sir, if general experience point in the same direction, and I think it does so, at least rather than otherwise, it must follow that the tuber containing the greatest proportion of juices, or, in other terms, a green or partially-ripened one will be the surest kind of seed, and, failing that, the leaving the potato uncut, ""sowing it in the round,"" may next be had recourse to — a practice which, in every instance within my limited knowledge, has proved an absolute security. I have observed many crops, and obtained accurate information regarding them, and nothing can be more conclusive than the fact arrived at, viz., that all that has been necessary to procure as good a crop as the ground, under the condition and management, was entitled to produce, was to commit the seed to the soil in an undivided state."
"At the same time I am free to confess that I can easily conceive (I think I have seen instances of it indeed) how a potato, apparently sound, upon a superficial examination, might not grow even when planted entire: it may already be too far gone—the superficial only be left sound. When cut up, however, and for a short time exposed to the atmosphere, its unfitness for seed could not escape detection from a skilful observer. He would know not to plant it in either way, cut or entire. The same tuber, however, on the principle I am contending for would have been"
"oO  productive, in an uncut state, long subsequent to the period at which it would have been useless, if divided. In the former case its scanty juices would have been preserved, in the latter they would have been speedily exhausted; the root would literally have bled to death, and then rotted away."
"Mr. Girdwood's experience, as stated at the Glasgow meeting, ought not to be allowed to give ""the death-blow to the cherished opinion,"" or hope that a new generation of plants, from healthy seed, might be the means of avoiding failure. I question not his, or any other single opinion, so far as it goes; but the fact of its being opposed by the experience of many, ought still to leave it an open question; were it only because, viewing it a priori, it is, of itself, so very promising. Besides, we know not how he treated his ground, his seed, his manure, or how he timed or tided his operations; and as we would be thankful even for imperfect remedies, before condemning any hint, we should be sure that an unsuccessful experiment, particularly when it stands in opposition to a number of successful ones, has been made with a sufficiency of skill, attention, means, &e., and that the statement implies neither more nor less than what is definitely expressed; and, particularly, that the individual be not something of what I am myself at this present moment — a stickler for some specific remedy, totally different from the one he condems. We often hecoma enthusiastic bigots to an opinion, without, being aware of it."
"""Plant your potatoes whole, and in the autumn, use only such seed as have their eyes plump, protect from frost, and, says Theory, you will have no failures. Not so fast says Mr. Burnet, of Gudgirth, I have done all this, and have experienced failures."" I quote from yourself. But what says practice on the part of many ? I will venture to say most, who have also tried this, in either autumn or spring! Exactly the contrary! ergo Mr Burnett's experience, standing by itself, should have little weight, allowing it all it can claim. It is a single contradiction, and no more, to something approaching to an almost established rule, and, as such, according to logical law, rather confirmatory of, than bearing against, the pro- position in question."
"I am far from questioning the accuracy of Mr. B.'s statement; at the same time, I can perceive how he may have had considerable difficulty in determining as to the precise nature or cause of the failure in question. I know, Mr. Editor, something, a good deal, indeed, of the constitution of a Scotch frost; it is often far frae canny. I have known it to penetrate the earth to the depth of feet—and, supposing such to bare been the state of matters, while Mr. B.'s experiment was being made, how was he to know, to a thing of nothing, how much or how little, of the failure was to be attributed to the potato itself, or whether, say, six weeks of a sound, ringing, black frost might have come in for a fair share of the blame?"
"Another farmer, Mr. Alexander, of Southbar, had never witnessed a failure in tor/t/-planted potatoes. I have myself, hitherto, seen few, nor have I met with more than a few who have seen more. When you insinuate, however, that the thing is not uncommon within a few miles of Dublin, I feel at once ready to credit it as a fact. But then, sir, you must answer me a few simple questions, relating to tbe practice of the Dublin farmers, with their con-acre coadjutors."
"14  In the first place, do they often plant their potatoes in drills ? Do they ever leave the dung lying in heaps,.and sometimes scattered over the beds or ridges for the space of two, four, six, or eight days, before covering it up with the mould ? do they ever plant a ridge, or a considerable. part of it, at one time of the day, leaving it to be over-taken by the slower operation of the spadesman, and thus allowing sufficient time for both seed and dung being well seasoned by sun and wind? If such should turn out to be no unfrequent practice in the vicinity of Dublin, sure I am yourself for one would not be much surprised should there now and then be found more than a few failures as the consequence, and yet I have seen all the above irregularities perpetrated, to the very letter, without a single apparent failure ensuing, when the work had been done early in the season."
"My own observation having been confined to two or three parishes, cannot be of much value when brought to bear on a subject involving the whole empire. Still, I think it my duty to state it the same as if it had been more extended."
"Most of my friends in this district, have, this year, planted at least a part of their crop with entire seed, and a few have used no other kind."
"Wherever this has been done all is well, never a plant apparently wanting, the crop generally fine. When the seed has been cut, there are several painful failures; and seldom one drill, one perch, at any given point, wholly right. I have had occasion to make the same remark in years past; and it is because of this, Mr. Editor, that I now obtrude myself upon you as so zealous an advocate for planting “in the round."" I feel certain, that had all the crops, under my eye been, this year, so managed, the general produce might have been at least a full fourth more than it will eventually turn out to be"

"SiR—You have lately published many remarks relative to the failure of the potato; some of them very learned and Jogical, fullof apriori and ergo's. lam only a plain working farmer, and never plant any of those ne fashioned kinds, sticking to the old Irish apples and cups My plan of operation I find to be as good as any I cai see or hear of, as I have never had a failure."
"When I dig or plough out my potatoes, (I prefer thi latter way, when the weather is dry,) I have them put into a pit four feet broad, and a foot deep ; the potatoe are raised in this in a conical shape, about four feet high and covered lightly with clay; before the frost sets in I thatch them; I do not stir them again until about three weeks before planting, when’! bring them home and put them into a house, and have them cut, leaving out the very large and very small, only using the middle-sized. I mix them with coal ashes, and do not plant them uniil I perceive a bud about the eighth of an inch appearing. While this growth is going on I get out my manure into rows, one perch between each line, and one or two"
"oO  perches between each load of about 15 cwt. When my seed has budded I begin to plant; I open my drills, and have the sets dropped by six girls, and the manure put on top of the sets by six men, (the men and girls are stationed along the lines at equal distances,) one plough opens and the other closes the drills. In this way I get down about two acres daily, eight drills to the perch. Following this plan, which I have done for years, I have never had a failure; and this year that there are so many, I have as fine a crop as ever grew. —"

"Sir — Seeing in your last GAZETTE, page 314, an article on the potato failures, I am induced to send the following extract from a correspondent of the Ayrshire Agriculturalists, just published, it is by Mr. Aiton of Hamilton, Scotland. His remarks fully bear out what I have stated in page 296; and by allowing it a place it may be of interest to your readers."
"“To the causes of the failure and remedies that have been proposed would be an endless task, as they are occasionally appearing in the newspapers every month; suffice it to say, that I consider that the whole failures have arisen from one -simple and obvious cause, viz., planting potato sets when the soil and dung into which they laid are too dry to bring the seeds to germination, and they wither and do not grow for the want of moisture. For some time after the failures appeared, I durst not venture to offer any opinion on the subject; but from seeing the fanciful opinions that began to be yonder as the causes of failure, I turned my attention to the subject and soon came to be satisfied that the evil arose entirely from the seed being placed in the ground when it and dung were too dry to bring on vegetation. And I have often, during the last four or five years, stated my opinions to that effect in the Kilmarnock Journal and some other publications; and now [ renew my averments on that subject with all manner of confidence, that they are indisputably correct; but others who were probably rnore conversant with practical husbandry than I am, having given various other opinions as to the causes of the failure, and how it could be remedied, and some of them introducing science into their remarks, the farmers seemed to think my opinions on the subject were too homely and simple, and seemed to look for some remedy that was more scientific or mysterious, and continued to plant as formerly, and have now to sustain the loss. It is, no doubt, true that the deficiency of the potato crop last year did not arise from the cause I have mentioned; but on the contrary, the potato seed time that year was wet as to rot some of the seeds in damp ground, and render the growth of that species of croppure until the weather become favourable. But in most of the other seasons since 1832, the drought has been so strong in April and May as to render the soil too dry for bringing on vegetation in the potato sets”."

"SIR — The discussion which took place at the public breakfast in Glasgow, under the auspices of the Agricultural Chemistry Association of Scotland, on the subject of potato failures, had for its object a collection of facts, founded upon practical experience, and not theories. |, amongst others, gave a few of the results of my own experience, without attempting to propound any theory. I stated that I had planted potatoes in autumn, and still had experienced failures in those kinds that failed in spring; and that those kinds which did not fail after autumn planting, did not fail after spring planting, &c. Some of your correspondents, I observe, have attempted to account for the above, but in a very unsatisfactory manner. Mr. M'Lellan talks very knowingly about a Scotch frost, and insinuates that that might have caused the failure in question. Now I beg to inform him that we had no frost last winter in the west of Scotland, within five miles of the sea-coast, producing ice exceeding one inch in thickness, nor of one week's continued duration; besides, if there had been such a frost as he hints at, the potatoes left in the ground would have equally suffered, which they did not. And it is well known that potatoes, although frosted, are in no way injured if thawed under ground, and away from the light and air."
"Having had time to consider the subject in all its bearings, I will now offer a few observations which may tend to throw some additional light upon it, and lead to further experiments. :"
"We got the potato originally over to this country in a healthy and sound condition, fresh from the hand of nature; and in spite of bad treatment, we maintained it so for a very long period. The best qualities were, of course, always run upon, and met with more bad treatment than the inferior kinds, having been longest in common cultivation."
"The potato in a state of nature is not fit for food, but is, on that account, perhaps a more hardy plant. As it becomes fit for food by forced cultivation, its chemical consti- tution is changed. Those kinds which have been most cultivated, as being the best in quality, contain the smallest percentage of starch — such as the rough reds— and are most liable to fail; while the worst qualities, which are not so much cultivated, contain a large amount of starch, and are scarcely known to fail. I believe it is remarked that all kinds are gradually improving in quality, and that new kinds are failing every year. When potatoes are first dug they invariably contain more starch than after being kept for four months in pits. “By keeping till the spring,” says. Professor Johnston, "" potatoes lose from 4 to 7 per cent, of their weight, and the quantity of starch they are capable of yielding suffers a considerable diminution. Thus, according to Payen, the same variety of potato yielded of starch in"
"October, —........ 17.2 per cent. November, ... _ 16.8 - December, ... ve 15.6 s January, ... we 15.5 ” February, ... a 15.2 » March, sae nena 15.0"
"O  April, ves os 14.5 ” This diminution is probably owing to the conversion of a portion of the starch into sugar and gum."
"It is more than probable that heating in the pit or otherwise diminishes the proportion of starch, and so weakens the germinative powers, During the growth the potato the parent tuber ferments and yields up its juices to the young plant; but if it ferments before the young plant can benefit by it, it is deprived of the nourishment intended for it, and fails in consequence. Whether the fermentation takes place in the pit, or after it is cut, or even after it is planted, or all combined, it is certain that one or other is a principal cause of failure. Some plant them whole, and so obviate a part of the evil; some plant early, and so the evil has not gone so far; some; prepare the land well, and the weakened plant gets through; some prepare the land half, and a complete failure is the _ consequence; some again take much pains to prevent heating in the pit and otherwise, but they plant the potato upon hot fermenting dung, and if the weather be dry and the land burned up, the plant ferments too rapidly and fails; and such may have been the case with my autumn planted potatoes—the tuber began to ferment, made a premature effort to fulfill the course of nature, but stopped short with a small tuber about three inches from the parent plant. Those planted later (in December) had colder weather and more moisture, and so succeeded. What I would recommend is this—avoid fermentation in every way—plant in deep, well- pulverized and rich soil, but not upon fermenting dung. It may be asked, when is the land to be made rich if not at the time of planting? I answer, that it must be previously put into good heart, either by ploughing in the manure the autumn before, by which means the fermentation in the dung will be over, or by planting potatoes after turnip, when the land will not only be sufficiently rich for potatoes, but will also be in a highly-pulverized and clean state. They can also be planted earlier, and when they come above ground they may get a hundred weight or two of guano, or other artificial manure, to help them on. We know that the best potatoes and the heaviest crops are obtained from old grass land without dung, why then should we wait till the land is quite exhausted by previous cropping before we plant our potatoes? and then gorge them with dung sufficient for four crops. This is perfectly inconsistent with nature. The best seed is said to be that from the high country, where they get little or no manure except peat ashes, and where they are cultivated more according to nature. They are not the best for food, it is true, but that is the best argument that they are the best for seed. It is well known that the flax crop would be ruined by a heavy application of dung, and yet the land must be in good heart, or the crop would be light. 1 conceive that for all crops the dung should be well incorporated with, the soil, and not applied in mass to the crop, but more particularly so for potatoes. It has always been a rule with me to have the dung well prepared before planting, so that the fermentation was in a great measure over, and I have only had one or two kinds that failed. Those planted in autumn were on dung in the first stage of fermentation, and they partially failed. I intend now to plant my potatoes on land manured in autumn, and a part after turnips with no additional manure except a slight dressing in spring, and 1 hope others will try the same mode of planting, and record the results."

18  ON POTATO FAILURES
"Farmers Gazette, September 21°, 1844, pages 345-346"
"""Who shall decide when doctors disagree."" siR—I perceive by your popular journal that the failure in the potato crop is exciting a very general interest, and various modes are suggested for their future prevention. ~ Amongst many others I have been much amused by the result of the meeting of the Scottish seers in Glasgow, which, from the variety of opinions and the means proposed to remedy the evil, reminds me of the Scotch blacksmith's definition of metaphysics, who, on being asked the meaning of that word by one of his customers, replied— "" He that's listening dis nae ken what he that's speaking means; an’ he that's speaking dis nae kea what he means himself; an’ that's metaphysics."""
"Now, sir, as I prefer practice to theory, I shall, with, your leave, give you the result of mine, which, if you think it worthy. of a place in your valuable GAZETTE, you are _ welcome to give to your readers."
"I have a field of five acres planted with potatoes, in which I have not a single missed potato that I can perceive, whilst my neighbours (some in the next field) are planting cabbages, and have sown turnip seeds in various places in parts of their fields where their potato crop has failed."
"My mode of proceeding was this—! ploughed the field during last winter, and cross- ploughed it after harrowing in the spring. It was again harrowed and rolled, bailing without success for moisture, I did not commence planting until after the 1st of May. I opened the drills in the morning, manured them by the same pair of horses in the course of the day, and closed them in the evening. By this means I had the moisture of the manure and earth about them. I took a hint from your excellent publication to plant the potatoes whole, a foot asunder in the drills, which are two feet and a half distant. Those chosen were a medium size, which, if cut, would make two sets. This mode saved the trouble of cutting, which, if performed according to the present practice, would be planted six inches asunder, which would amount to the same thing as to the quantity of seed. They were of three different kinds—Cups, Cork Reds, and Black Seedlings—some kept in pits and some in houses, but all have thriven alike. The field is to be seen on the left-hand side of the high road leading from Aughuacloy to Caledon, within half a mile of the former town, in this county (Tyrone): and if there was even one farming society in the county, I would challenge any of its members to match it, but unfortunately there is not; for although you state in your invaluable little Tract on Farming that there is one at"" Lifford, in Tyrone,"" that place is the assize town for the county Donegal, and cannot, consequently, be in Tyrone—the farmers of which are left with high rents to grope their way for improvement in the dark, notwithstanding which Tyrone is a peaceable and loyal county."

"RESPECTED FRIEND—! have seen some remarks on the failure of the potato, by W. M'Lellan. He says, the cause of the failure appears as yet to be a secret. The nearest cause we can trace seems to be a lack of moisture in the soil, eventuating in dry rot immediately after being committed to the ground. He goes on to say, that a green or unripe potato, according to his experience, rarely failed, particularly if set early, while dry and mealy ones are not apt to grow luxuriantly, and often not at all, &c. Now, as to the last, I would say, that William Andrews, of Comber, who out of many others that had written on the failure of the potato, was the one awarded the gold medal, by (if I do not mistake) the Royal Dublin Society, about seven years since; and it will probably be fresh in the memory of many of thy readers, that a want of sufficient maturity in the seed was one of the chief causes that he attributed the failure to, and gave, as be thought, I suppose, good proof for the same, from actual practice of himself and others. Here, then, is some practical proof ""which points in a diametrically opposite direction;"" and although I have made this statement, I am not inclined to join with Andrews, but just wish to show W. MIL. that all are not upon his side. I quite agree with him in thinking, that the whole potatoes seem to be the surest chance. I cut part of mine this season, and left about the one-half uncut, which I invariably set in the roughest of the ground; withal, they seem to be the best, and the cuts bad a few misses, while the others had hardly any. There has, however, a failure appeared this season, as well as last, in ths neighbourhood which I wish him, if possible, to account for, not in the late but the early potatoes, that is, a partial rot which has appeared several weeks since; with some almost half the crop is lost, some less, and some more. I have not observed any in my own, but two of the workmen who got seed from me, same as my own, have both decayed ones: another neighbour was telling me that part of his garden is so, and part not, both in ridges and drills, and all, I believe, of the same seed; now, I would wish to know how he would account for this, as I think he cannot attribute it to any neglect in not covering the manure, &e."
"Since writing the foregoing, I went to make further inquiry respecting the last case, and he says the garden was all set in the one day—his wife setting, and himself covering at the same time—and he considered there was none of them more than half an hour bare, the day also was cool and dark. Those affected with the rot decay prematurely in the tops, while others alongside continue green. I was also making further inquiry of others, and the rot is not confined to heavy or wet soil. The first appearance of decay is little white specks; and I understand that In the course of one or two day safter being dug they get quite rotten. The wife of the neighbour ailuded to was telling me that some of those were dug from amongst the rotted ones, and boiled on standing to the second day had emitted a most disa- greeable smell. Quite different from common sourness, and were not at all fit to be"
"20  used, though good at first. But what need we talk of failure of the potato alone. Let us look round and see what other diseases have taken place in both the animal and vegetable system. Witness the failures that have taken place in wheat, and also other diseases among cattle, and pigs; the latter in a form perhaps never before heard in these countries, and all within the last twelve or fifteen years. Many learned and practical men have written volumes upon these subjects, and to what purpose? Why one assigning one cause, and another the very opposite while the real cause in my opinion being quite overlooked, it being I believe, neither more or less than the visitation of Providence."

"TO PREVENT POTATO FAILURES Farmers Gazette, September 21%, 1844, pages 346"
"siR—Notwithstanding all that has bean said and written concerning potatoes and their cause of failure, much remains to be discovered: a great deal of valuable information has, however, been obtained ; and by attention to what has been clearly established -as causes, aiding and accessary, if not the principal, I am satisfied that failures may be, in a great measure, though not perhaps entirely avoided. There can be no doubt that in many places, and as to many kinds, the tuber has degenerated, so that it will either fail entirely when any additional predisposing cause is superacdded, or send up a puny stalk, and often, even when there is no suspicion of failure, the produce will be very poor. :"
"The time for pitting or storing will commence next month, when attention should be directed to a suitable mode, and encouragement given for experiments."
"There is an important remark as to the selecting of seed, that I am not aware has been mentioned, at least not sufficiently noticed, viz., in choosing seed for planting, either whole or for cutting, all potatoes that are changed from the natural shape are deteriorated. So that of a kind that is naturally long, all round ones or approaching to round, though sound and good, should be discarded, as also all flat or longish ones of a kind naturally round; any red streak or discoloration through the potato proves it on the decline, though shape be good and eyes deep. I consider a deep indenture at the eye a good sign; and if the eye be flat, that is, even, or nearly so, with the surface, an indication of bad or sickly-vegetating powers."
"i cut my seed longways, i.e., through the two ends, and would not wish to make more than two sets of one potato. I cut and use them as quickly as possible, the same, or the next day, covering up with straw or winnow-cloth any that are taken to the field for setting, and earth them in the drill as soon as possible."
"When the curl appears, get fresh seed from some other place. For all uplands, the planting some in moss, in June for seed, makes a good change—a sound healthy potato, well-shaped, deep eye, well kept, showing in spring a large full bud, will, doubtless, grow and do well; but if the seed be not changed, there will be a tendency to deterioration. This is the case in all plants and vegetables. In Holland they get Riga"
"O  flax-seed every year, from which to get seed for the next. Grass seeds degenerate. I get fresh every year to keep for seed the year after. Oats degenerate. I seldom use grain off my farm more than two years, unless 1 have changed to boggy land."
"Seeds, in many cases, will grow, and thus deceive the farmer, while the produce, in weight and quality, will be very much less than if there had been a change of seed; as a general rule, I would prefer a change from poorer land and a colder district —"

THE CROP
"Farmers Gazette, September 21°, 1844, pages 346"
"SIR—I am happy to be able to state a considerable improvement in the appearance of the potato crop since the late rains: the failures which, at the commencement of the season, were alarming, are not so perceptible now, being re-sown in many instances, and in others the luxuriant growth of the stalks cover the ground. There is a great breadth of ground under potatoes in this vicinity. I should think that the crop will not be a deficient one. There will be a greater consumption of them, owing to the defi- ciency of hay, which is not two-thirds of a crop, and farmers will have to draw on their potatoes to bring their stock over the winter. The great abundance of hay last winter enabled the farmer to economize his potato crop, and the failures, though extensive, were’ not felt. This season the farmer has not the hay crop to fall back on, but the season will bewell watched, and. in many instances, rape and other early spring food has been sown; and what is more important, the farmers will be induced to sow turnips more extensively the ensuing season, seeing, from experience their value, particularly when there is a deficient crop of hay, and the chance of failures in their potato crop."
"The wheat, as in many other places, is verv fine. The farmers are not willing to thresh at the present low prices, consequently but small quantities are exhibited for sale. I think it would be advisable for the farming societies to bind up some of your useful tracts along with their reports, and thus circulate useful knowledge among the farmers. I think a tract on ploughing would be very acceptable."
"Yours, &c., R. C.K. Thurles, Sept. 18, 1844."
"ENORMOUS CROP OF POTATOES Farmers Gazette, September 21°', 1844, pages 347"
"Sir — The following account of a heavy crop of potatoes may not be uninteresting to you and to some of your readers: — Early in January of the present year I planted 13.5 yards of a drill, three feet wide, with 27 whole Black Seedling potatoes, each the size of a man's fist, and dropped at a distance of 16 inches in the drill."
"22  They were manured with a small quantity of refuse wool steeped in a Solution of burned bones by sulphuric acid, the free phosphoric and sulphur acids having been neutralized with carbonate of soda. The manure was first laid in the drill, then covered with a thin layer of earth, and on this were laid the potatoes, enveloped in lime, and covered with mould to the depth of tweleve inches. In ‘April they were top-dressed, at the rate of five cwt. to the acre, with a compound formed by mixing in equal proportions, carbonate, nitrate, muriate, and; sulphate of soda, containing a considerable quantity of uncombined acid, sulphate of ammonia, and sulphate of magnesia: after this application their growth was most luxuriant. On the 17th instant the drill was dug, and the produce when placed in the scale was found to weigh 2 cwt. 3 quarters and 16 Ibs imperial, or at the rate of 83 tons 19 cwt. 1 quarter 10 Ib. per Irish acre, which, at 34s. per ton, would amount to rather more than £142 per acre —"

"ON THE POTATO FAILURE Farmers Gazette, October 5'"", 1844, pages 377"
"Sir — I have received much information from your paper, but in your last correspondent W. T. states a few things respecting the potato that my short experience differs from. He is particular in the shape of his seed, so am |; I dislike a deep eye as a table potato as is difficult to clean and wasteful. I do not see the absolute necessity of changing the seed. My principal crop consists of two sorts, the seed of which I have not changed these seven years—the early, a round, white potato, and Jersey, a late, mealy, and prolific reddish oval potato. Last year I exchanged a sack with a friend at six miles' distance for one of his, from seed procured the year before from Jersey, and planted in order to try the effect of the change in the same manner. The result was, the old seed produced twelve measures, when the new only produced eight. Morton says the seed has not been changed on the Stincheomhe farm for many years—if I remember right, thirty. I have tried many sorts, generally some new one every year, but find after two or three years, they want changing, not being suited to the soil. I almost forgot to mention that my seed was not superior on my friend's soil."
"‘There is one cause of failure in the case of whole seed not mentioned by any of your correspondents—namely, the finger blight, which generally attacks the sets the night after planting, and carries off all the seed."
"Yours, &c. S. E. Bistern Closes, nr. Ringwood, Hants 28"" September, 1844"
"[The crow blight, as has been recently observed by one of our correspondents, does"
"indeed attack the sets in this country. We, however, know no such disease as that to which our correspondent refers, and are grieved to find that it is known anywhere.]"
"©  ON PLANTING POTATOES SO AS TO AVOID FAILURES Farmers Gazette, October 5'"", 1844, pages 377"
"SIR—As I never had a failure in my potato crop, no matter how dry the season, I think, perhaps, that though a poor man, you would willingly receive a few hints from me. It being my only crop, and my only means of support, I am particular about it; and my way of working is this:—In well-prepared ground, that is, ground that has been drained, and got its regular number of winter and spring ploughings, and harrowing and rolling, in a dry season such as the past, I open the drills, put in the manure, and cover it the day before I plant the potatoes, commencing between three and four o'clock in the morning, and stopping from eleven till about two o'clock, leaving the manure as short time as possible exposed to the weather. The next day I kib in the potatoes (stick them in at the back of the spade,) the manure, during the night, acquires a dampness, which better prepares it for the reception of the seed. I always prefer the sets cut fresh, from a pit, as I set them. In the choice of seed I would always prefer that grown on a different kind of manure, and off a different kind of land; I would also, for seed, prefer that from drills to that from lazy beds. I observe a great many letters on manures in your GAZETTE; but, sir, did you ever try equal quantities of clay and bog-stuff, soured with pot-ale, as hot as it can be got out of the distillery? for it exceeds all other manure; and you can tell where it has been for three or four crops after. It gives the finest flavoured potato, and of the finest quality, as well as greatest quantity: even the manure of cattle fed on grains or wash, gives finer crops than when fed in any other way; and the potatoes are quite different looking from the same kind set on other manure; but on grass meadow land it exceeds every other kind. I differ in opinion with some of your correspondents, who assert that the Cup potatoes bear no seed—it carries its seed on the stem."
"Yours, &c., JAMES TAYLOR, Newtown Cunningham, October 1, 1844."
"I would always, if possible, like to get down the potatoes not later than the middle of April. We have not the least doubt, the plan here recommended will be extensively tried next season, and we earnestly hope that our correspondent's experience as to the necessity of covering up the manure, and not allowing it, as is but too much the practice, to be bleached on the field before it is used, would have its due weight with small farmers. By potato seed is understood the grains enclosed in the potato-apple, which succeeds the blossom—not the tubers which are sometimes borne on the stem. We had never heard of the efficacy of pot-ale as manure. A Dundalk correspondent informs us, that the refuse hops of breweries is one of the most potent manures ever tried."
EXPERIMENT ON THE AUTUMN PLANTING OF POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, October 5‘, 1844, pages 377 As this is the season for trying the experiment of planting potatoes in dry, well- prepared land, as reported by one of your English correspondents about two years past, he stating that he had successfully sown his crop of potatoes in October for the then last five years, I now give you my experience of that plan. In October, 1842 I planted a few drills, following his directions, namely: I opened the drills very"
"24  deep, placed the manure in them, drew down, with a rake, a small quantity of earth over the manure, to prevent the potato from being in contact with it, planted the potato whole, and then covered in the drills, placing the earth as high as possible over them, with the two-fold view of their being well covered from frost, as also from the depth of furrow, that they should lie high and dry throughout the winter; thus the drills remained until the latter end of April, when the superfluous clay was harrowed off them, to allow the influence of air and sun; after this period the crop was managed as one sows at the ordinary season."
"As your correspondent stated, the potatoes lay uninjured throughout the winter, and at the natural period for vegetation, they proceeded to grow, without receiving any check, as spring-sown potatoes do, from handling, bruising, heating in houses or pits, and breaking off of shoots. The produce was excellent in quantity and quality."
"In October, 1843, I again tried this plan, and sowed half an Irish acre. The kinds I planted were, the white and purple Bangors, the red-nosed kidney, the purple kid- ney, and a few drills of the crow cup potato. This latter sort had some failures, whether owing to the seed itself, or that it was partly caught by rain, I cannot say, but all the Bangor and kidney potatoes succeeded perfectly. They are most plentiful in the ground, and superior in quality; in short, I consider it a most valuable plan, and well worthy of agriculturists giving it a fair trial."
"Your English correspondent gave many excellent reasons and arguments in its favour, which I am sure must be in your recollection; and he stated, that for many years before he tried it, he had been subject to continual and extensive failures in that crop, but that for the five years he tried it, he had no failure whatsoever. From my own two years' experience, I perfectly believe him; the potato, however, should be put in, and the whole operation concluded before the rain sets in—"

"siR—In connection with my letter respecting the depriving potatoes of their blossoms, &c., which appeard in the GAZETTE of 17th August last, I have to state, that each subsequent day's digging produced the same result as those already reported, and have no doubt that, if duly attended to, the depriving potatoes of their blossoms will materially improve the quantity and quality. As regards that portion of your correspondence, which relates to the saving such for seed I cannot stste anything, not having tried it."

"A PROFITABLE MODE OF CULTIVATING EARLY POTATOES Farmers Gazette, October 12'"", 1844, page 393"
"SIR—When about to plant some ash-leaved potatoes in a border of my garden this season, I directed three drills to he planted on cabbage-stalks without any other manure, and to my surprise these three were the only drills in the plot free from failures, and their produce was ready for the table before that of the other drills manured with good fam-yard manure—the after-culture being the same in both cases. The mode of planting I found answer was best: to place cabbage-stalks in the bottom of the drill, and then spread over them a little of the soil, just sufficient to form a level bed for the potato. When the cabbage-stalks were put over the seed, the stalk vegetated and sent up shoot, which were troublesome. When the potatoes had got their last moulding, there was planted in the furrows early broccoli, which had the earth drawn up to it as the potatoes were dug. The brocoli has yielded a most plentiful supply from the middle of August to the present time, and I am now about to plant the ground with the kind of potato called crufles, using heds of the broccoli as manure. By placing two stalks in the bottom of the drill, side by side with a slight covering of of mould, a species of drain will be formed which will prevent a superabundance of moisture collecting around the seed, and so tend materially, as I conceive, to its preservation during the winter. I never before had so fine a crop of cabbages as I have this season—having used no manure except the ammoniacal gas water, applied in a liquid form each time that the cabbages were moulded or dug about.—"
"Yours, &¢.,T. C., Cranebrook, October 7, 1844."
"EXPERIMENT ON PLANTING POTATOES IN AUTUMN Farmers Gazette, October 26t, 1844, page 425"
"Sir—Owing to some observations in your GAZETTE of last year vi set a quantity of different kinds of potatoes, on light ground with sandy subsoil, ia the end of November, and the beginning of December. I manured well and laid a little light stable manure over the sets, both in ridges and drills, allowing three drills to one ridge; and having now dug all out, I think it but right to tell you something of the result."
"They were not earlier than those set for early potatoes in spring, but had not one night's frost put them back they would have been considerably more forward than they were, but I would not say that they would have been earlier than others. The drills exceeded the ridges in produce, but I think the ridges were covered rather too deeply. The ""farmers"" were the best crop; and seedlings next, but I think the white potatoes were not a good kind of seed. There was a very good crop, but they were put in whole. A few sets were cut and rotted. On the whole, I scarcely recommend"
"26  it, as the days for planting are short, and the weeds get up more abundantly; but anyone might try it, observing not to cut the seed."
"‘Yours &c., E.F.K., Lisburn, Oct. 21, 1844"
"POTATO FAILURES Farmers Gazette, November 2"", 1844, page 441"
"Sir— In your paper of the 12th instant is a letter on the failure of the potato crop, signed by T. Robertson, reflecting on the Chemical Association of Scotland, in endeavouring to ascertain its cause by a collection of facts and not theories and asks if the contradicting facts are any better than the merest theories? Facts no doubt, “are stubborn things,"" and often have a strong propensity to contradict theories; but in my opinion they will always (when rightly understood) be found to be in the strictest harmony with each other."
"In looking over the very ingenious and_ plausible observations of your correspondent, I regret that there are several important points upon which he has failed to convince me that his views are correct. He seems to ascribe the cause of the late failures entirely to the improved system of husbandry, which has made so much progress in the country for the last thirty years. The only proof he gives of this is, that the failures commenced in the improved districts and from them spread to other parts of the country. This, no doubt, may be true; but what will Mr. R say to that fact, that the most extensive failures have taken place in districts in the north and west of Ireland where not the slightest alteration had been made in their mode of cultivation for more than a century past and where they are to this day as ignorant of the value of turnips, rape-cake and thorough- draining, as their ancestors were in the days of Queen Elizabeth."
"Mr. R., in his further remarks, appears to have mistaken the nature of vegetable nutrition and decomposition altogether. He argues that the starchy part of the plant has no direct influence on the growth of the plant; that a want of it cannot be cause of failure, but the very reverse; and that it is the albuminous and glutinous part that is the only cause of their nutrition and growth!! Now jt mast be obvious to anyone in the least acquainted with vegetable physiology, that both are essentially necessary to the formation of the first leaves and roots of plants, and that neither of them alone, but both simultaneously act upon each ‘other at the very commencement of germination. The gluten is first altered, and acquires the power of changing the starch into sugar, both become soluble in water, and are conveyed to every part of the plant, and both are thus completely consumed before it receives any nourishment from the soil."
"That a superabundance of starch, sugar, &c., in the potato should be the cause of its putrefaction and decay, appears to me a most unaccountable assertion, for the most superficial observer must have seen among rotten potatoes quantities of starch quite unchanged after every other part of the potato had completely decayed. Now, the very reverse of his view is the fact, for it is the albuminous and glutinous part alone that is the sole cause of the putrefaction of all animal"
"O  and vegetable substances. If you succeed in preserving this part, all the others will remain unchanged. It is by the power of forming solid compounds with albumen that all anti-sceptic substances owe their value in preserving flesh, as common salt, alum, corrosive sublimate, and many others; and if this change be not effected, every constituent of the animal or vegetable will soon become disorganized and reduced to its original elements. :"
"That potatoes raised upon a rich early soil are liable to failure I readily agree to, especially if pitted, or put in large heaps; and perhaps a few additional remarks may serve to place the matter in a stronger light. The natural state of the potato in the ground, until the return of spring, very strongly resembles the hybernation or winter sleep of certain animals; its vegetative powers remain dormant until the increasing temperature of the season awakens its vegetative powers. Now, it is a remarkable fact, that if an animal during its hibernation be revived and kept in a state of activity for any length of time, exhaustion and death is the inevitable result. If we be here permitted to draw the analogy between animal and vegetable life, it will be readily seen the dangerous consequences that may arise from exciting prematurely the vegetative powers of the plant. The caution is particularly necessary in early districts and in mild winters. Everyone must recollect the extreme mildness of the early part of last winter; and about the beginning of January I saw potatoes that had been thrown into a heap with buds fully half a foot in length, and several farmers whom I know had to sell off the greater part of their stock before Christmas, their own natural heat and that of the season had, caused them to ferment, the dry rot made its appearance, and had they not disposed of them, they would in a ver short time all have become tainted."
"It may be here remarked that, in this point of view, ?eed from moory and late soils or lean seed, as Mr. R. calls them, have a decided advantage over those from more rich and early soils, they neither vegetate so early, nor will they heat or ferment under circumstances that would destroy the others, they consequently retain all their natural vigour, until the time of planting arrives, but here all advantage from them ends. They are certainly less strong and vigorous in their growth, and will fail under certain circumstances that a healthy rich plant from an earlier soil would not be affected by. I speak this from experience and repeated observation. The only extensive failure I ever had was from seed raised upon a soil that had never borne a crop before. I have seen many cases of the same kind since, and several during the past year. It would appear to me, that being more weak and watery in their constitution, they are less able to withstand the parching wind; and hot sunshine that generally prevails at the time of panting, they shrivel up and lose vitality, if exposed only for a few minutes to its influence."
"In conclusion, I would remark that most people seem to forget that there a-.'e certain conditions essentially necessary to the growth of every plant, no matter how healthy it may be, and it is from inattention to this that so many opposite and conflicting statements are daily published. We may fancy one coning forward and saying that he put a seed potato only for half a minute into boiling water and it did not grow- “I think that heat must be the cause,” “That cannot be” says his neighbor “for I left a few out one frosty night and not one of them ever came up — I think cold must be the cause.” A third asserts that wet must be the reason for"
"28  he put a few into a pail of water for a week and they every one rotted. “You must be mistaken” says a forth “for I cut a few and planted them in dry sand, and not one of them ever came up, it must therefore be drought or want of moisture that them fail."" Now here is a sample of as contradictory facts as any yet published by the association, yet they are strictly true. I have chosen extreme cases, but they suffice to show how readily people may fancy their seed has been unsound, while in reality the conditions in which it has been placed have been such, that it is impossible that any plant could vegetate,—"

"Sir - The Isle of Man grows numerous quantities of potatoes and this year the failures have been great; but what grew are very large and good (cups are the principal crop). Although the season has been very dry, and as we had no rain, yet the potatoes have rotted in the drill, many farmers had to ship theirs immediately. I myself had nearly three acres, and when taking them up I found some of the largest in the hollow of the drill rotten, I pitted them as done in Ireland, and when I opened them to take some in, I found an immense quantity rotten—so much so, that had I not been obliged to open them at this time, by another month I do not think I would have had any but tainted ones: I would have lost all. I am obliged to ship them to England, but will be at a great loss, they are buying here at 6s, the boll of 4 cwt., or 1s. 6d. per cwt. The soil they grew on was sandy, light and perfectly dry, such as the north of the island. I believe it is a general complaint, although few wish it to be known, lest it might injure the sale. They are shipping to England as fast as possible."
"The turnip crop here is a complete failure, and food will be very scarce. Few here"
"can stall-feed cattle, nor is it worth their while, except good ones for the English market, and few of such are on the island. Good American beef is selling for 1.5d. per"
"O  Ib.; and I am told, when watered, is very good. Wheat, barley, and oats are dearer than in Ireland: the latter is scarce, as the soil is too sandy and light to grow it. I have known farmers who kept eight horses working, and who had not one pound weight of hay of any kind, but who used steamed turnips and cut straw or chaff, yet kept them in good working condition, far better than I have seen farmers’ horses in Ireland. I think the farmers in Ireland should follow this plan, and sell their hay. I know by experience that far more goes to loss and waste in an Irish farmer's yard and stable, than would keep double the quantity of stock."

"AN EXPERIMENT ON POTATOES BY JOHN GREY, ESQ., OF DILSTOK Farmers Gazette, December 7"", 1844, page 516"
"Although the instances of failures in the potato crop in this district are fewer, and to much less extent this year, than in many former seasons, a detail of an experiment which I have now proved, showing the comparative produce of autumn and spring-planted potatoes, both of which were very full crops on the ground, may throw some light on the subject, and at all events show that the fear of the plants being destroyed by frosts in the winter, on tolerably dry land—and no one should plant potatoes on any other—is visionary."
"Immediately after the harvest in 1843, I had a piece of oat stubble turned up with three horses on a plough, as deep as the soil would admit of. The land was a damp loam, on a retentive subsoil, but had been thorough-drained the previous year: it was then ploughed across, it was made up into drill-rows of the width of 30 inches. About the 20th October, when the potatoes of that year were taken up, it was planted, partly with small potatoes while, and partly with large ones cut in two, having had a moderate quantity of dung, but slightly fermented, applied fo it; the drill-rows were then ploughed up pretty deep, so as to give the plants a good cover. In the latter end of April, 1844, a harrow was run along the rows, to break the crust and admit the air, as well to give opportunity of picking off any couch or roots that might be turned up. Very soon aftr this Operation, the shoots of the new crop appeared in great numbers, to the surprise of some of my good neighbours, who thought that I was adopting a very heterodox practice. The land underwent the usual course of hand hoeing and scuffling, until the time came when the tops being sufficiently large, that the rows should be earthed up. Before doing so, I had 1 cwt. per acre of guano sown broadcast over them, which the plough, immediately following, turned up against the plants. I did this on the ground that the tubers are thrown out laterally from the stem, require more support to bring them to perfection, than they can derive from the manure which is placed in the hollow centre of the drills. The crop went on with a promising appearance throughout, but did not exhibit any unusual bulk of tops. On each side of this plot, a piece of ground was worked and planted"
"30  with potatoes in the end April in rows of the same width, and receiving in every respect the same treatment, except that the dung having lain longer in a heap, and become more compressed, must have been applied in rather a larger proportion. The plants in this case consisted entirely of large potatoes cut in two, and the same application of guano was given to the others. In these plots no failure occurred; the ground was well covered, and the tops were more luxuriant than in the autumn-planted piece, so that it seemed very doubtful which of the two would in the end be the most productive. The tops of the autumn planted ones fell, indicating ripeness, a fortnight before and were taken up in the beginning of October. The adjoining rows of each plot were carefully taken up with the grape, or three-pronged fork, and put into sacks so that no mixture could take place, and afterwards a row in the middle of each plot, so as to come to a correct average; the sacks were then weighed, and the result was as follows : —"
"The autumn planting with small potatoes whole, gave at the rate of 100 loads per acre of 20 stones each."
Ditto with large potatoes cutin two 111 do.
Spring planting with ditto 86 do.
"The kind of potato on which this experiment was tried, is that known in these parts by the name of Hen’s-nest. The quality is good in all the plots, but the autumn if anything, rather more mealy. ; ."
"I am repeating the experiment this year planted, a fortnight ago, some whole potatoes cut in two; but in the former, I have this time kept out the very small ones, and planted only those a medium size, whole; for it seemed to me last year that some of them had been planted of too small a size, which caused them to put out too many shoots, and with inadequate vigour. Another experiment may, perhaps, vary the comparative produce, and tend to establish the point of preference between autumn and spring-planting. As no failure took place in any of these plots, we have no right to presume, from this experiment, that autumn planting will prove an antidote to that growing calamity; but as far as my observation goes, I am strongly inclined to think that it affords a security against it, and that principal causes of failure are to be traced to injury sustained by the seed, from being improperly kept during the winter, and its vegetative power being exhausted by shoots that have been made before planting in the spring, as well as by the planting being deferred till the ground, under the process of working has been too much deprived of its moisture. Against these causes of failure the autumn-planting is a security; and if the result of future experiments should bear out that which I have now detailed, the advantage of planting in autumn will, I think, be fully established. It has been stated as an objection to autumn-planting, that time is not allowed for cleaning the land sufficiently as to make it fit for sowing to grass with the ensuing corn crop; but I should call it bad farming to have land so foul, after one crop of corn, as to present this difficulty. Besides which, as autumn-planted potatoes are generally ready to be taken up in the beginning of October, a considerable time is available for preparing the land, either for receiving winter wheat, or spring corn. Independent of which, it is possible so to arrange it as to have the potato crop succeeded in the following year by one of Swedish, or other turnips; and thus affording the fullest opportunity of sowing"

"EXPERIMENTS WITH POTATOES Farmers Gazette, December 21°', 1844, page 548"
"The next paper, on the results of comparative experiments made by Mr. James Melvin, Bonnington, near Ratho, on potatoes imported from different countries on the Continent, with the common varieties cultivated in this country, was read by Mr. Boyle, yr. of Shewalton. The foreign varieties consisted of two from Hamburg, and one from Holland. They all had, when planted, an unpromising appearance, being small, even smaller than the out-riddlings in this country—green and watery when boiled—having a clear, thin skin when washed, and showing a great many eyes. The soil in which they had grown had _Stained them with a brownish black colour. Of the two varieties from Hamburg, one was white, the other pink; and that from Holland was white. They were planted in two fields, occupying in all fully a Scotch acre, in a manner precisely similar to the potatoes of this country. The Hamburg pink almost entirely rotted in the ground. The two white varieties manifested at first an unfavourable appearance, sending up puny shoots— every eye, however, sent, up a shoot— and as most of the tubers had been planted whole, and the people, fearing to lose the crop, from their smallness, insisted on planting two together, and the number of shoots that came up crowding together, showed at once that the crop had been too closely planted. After the stems had risen about two feet they interlaced in the drills, and presented a surface of uniform levelness, and at length towered far above the common varieties in the same field. The Dutch white exhibited a white blossom, with a few seed-apples; the Hamburg white, a beautifully purple .and highly odorous blossom but no seed-apples. The leaves of the Dutch sort had fallen, while those of the Hamburg remained vigorous and green when the crop was taken up. In regard to comparative produce, in one field, the Hamburg white yielded 12 tons per acre, while the common Dons gave only 6 tons, with 20 tons of farmyard dung, and 3 cwt. of specific manure, of the value together of £7-7s per acre. In the other field, the Dutch white aiso yielded 12 tons, and the Dons 7 tons per acre, with 24 tons of farm-yard dung, and 3 cwt. of specific manure, at a cost of £8-1s per acre. The few Hamburg whites which had been planted by accident among the Hamburg pinks that rotted, having plenty of room to grow about four yards to each plant their stems spread greatly about, and in taking up the crop, scat- tered as it was, each stem produced from 10 to 20 marketable potatoes; others had as many large ones, with from 20 to 60 small; several had 90: and one had 102 potatoes, from the size of a boy's marble to those of an ordinary sized potato. The Dutch white are the best to eat, but none of the foreign varieties are good for the table, being watery, though they seem well adapted for cattle, producing at one-third more than either the Buffs or Dons."
"On another farm the Hamburg white gave from a sandy meadow 15.5 tons per acre, while the Dons only yielded 8.5 tons, and the Early-lates 9.25 tons. On a third farm, from strong soil, but drained, the Hamburg white yielded 7 tons an acre more than the common sorts beside it."
"32  FARINA OF DAMAGED POTATOES Farmers Gazette, December 28"", 1844, page 570"
"siIR—It occurred to me a few days back that it would be well to ascertain if the farina was greatly diminished and much impaired in potatoes in a state of decomposition: I accordingly experimented on a few—the white description; they were quite soft and discoloured, but not so much decomposed as to prevent their being washed. I found that they yielded about 14 per cent, of farina (the usual produce of that description of potato), the quality of which, with the exception of being - a litle dull in colour, seemed to be unimpaired, inasmuch as it made a strong and as adhesive a paste as that obtained from sound potatoes. I mention the circumstance with the hope through the instrumentality of your useful journal, the fact might be made extensively known, and, consequently, that a portion of that useful root, now so considerably attacked with "" wet rot,"" might be preserved, either for domestic use or as an article of commerce."

"Mr. Colman, agricultural commissioner from the State of Massachusetts, favoured —"
the council with the communication he had just received from the United States:—
"""! believe I wrote to you that I had been making various experiments on the potato disease, chiefly under the microscope; and that I had come to the conclusion that it was a fungus, resembling smut on corn; and also that lime, common salt, and various other salts (as arsinnate of soda, &c.), were complete remedies; and that I had agitated the subject here in various ways. This has produced much evidence confirming my conclusions; such that in fields where potatoes were planted between rows of Indian corn (a common practice here) wherever there was smut on the corn, there the potatoes were diseased; but in contiguous places, with the same seed potato, where there was no smut, there was no disease. Instances of accidental application of salt for other purposes preventing disease, when adjoining places without salt, had it, are rather numerous; and in one case, where a farmer had manured half his field with a compost containing much seaweed, and had not enough to put on the other half, using therefore other manure; the seaweed was free from disease, while the other half had it badly."

"DRY ROT IN POTATOES Farmers Gazette, March 15"", 1845, page 744"
"We are not acquainted with any method by which dry-rot or mildew in potatoes can be cured, If the disease has once firmly established itself, the potatoes are quite unfit for seed, and, ought, therefore, to be rejected. Good analysis of theI potatoes are much to be desiderated, so that it may be discovered whether the disease arising from any chemical causes ageeting either their organic or inorganic constituents. Diseased potatoes invariably contain a smaller quantities of water than sound ones—to the extent sometimes of 20 per cent. This dry starchy condition, accompanied, as it sometimes is, with a decomposition of the glutenous part of the potato, pre-disposes it to the attacks of fungi. The disease called dry-rot may then be considered as the consequence of a disturbance of the ultimate or proximate constituents of the potato, and not the cause of the disease itself. We shall endeavour to pive some more information on this subject, in an early number of the GAZETTE, accompanied with suggestions for preventing the occurrence of dry-rot."

"SIR—Whilst removing my potatoes from the pits to the barn last year, I had the small ones picked out, and left in the pits to be brought in at a future time for the use of the pigs, &c. In one instance these refuse were forgotten, nor did I notice them till they were green above a slight sprinkling of clay which was cast upon them at the time the large potatoes were removed. I had the shoots carefully taken from the potatoes, and having got drills opened and filled with dung, I got them sowed in the same manner as cabbage plants, to the extent of about 10 square perches. The potatoes answered as well as ever for what they were previously intended. This was about the 14th of May; and although 1 suffered severely from the miss in the potato crop last season, I can assure you, that not one of these shoots received any blight. The crop was both earlier and more abundant than potatoes of the same kind (pink eyes) sown in the usual way, about the middle of March in the same ground, and treated in a similar manner—lf you deem the above worthy of public notice, please insert in your next publication, aud by so doing you will mch oblige,"

"34  ON AMETHOD OF PREPARING POTATOES FOR SEED Farmers Gazette, March 22%, 1845, page 754"
"The next paper by Mr. Joseph Smeal, gardener to the Earl of Morton, at Dalmahoy, was read by Mr. J. Hall Maxwell, younger, of Dargavel. The potatoes intended for seed are taken out of the ground by Mr. Smeal in the beginning of September, or earlier if the crop is sufficiently matured, and spread upon the surface of the ground, where they remain exposed to the sun and weather till such time as they become quite green in colour, and of a soft, spongy consistence. This will be effected in the course of a month or sir weeks, during which time they -must be turned at least once, and which can easily be done with a wooden rake. The greening process is much forwarded by sunshine, but it is desirable in all cases to have the potatoes lifted in sufficient time to allow the process to be com- pleted before the frost sets in; though Air. Smeal has observed, that potatoes so treated are less liable to be affected by frosts than the others, or to be attacked by vermin and insects when stored, on account of the bitter disagreeable taste they contract. The prepared potatoes may be stored in pits or houses in the usual way. Tk« a,-.»t »J»«,,tnsc of ihis method or preparing seed potatoes, according to Mr. Smeal, is the certainty of a good and early crop. The potatoes may be planted whole, and the small ones selected to save expense; but, if the latter be preferred, they had better be prepared by cutting a piece off one end ""in the autnnra, to afford time for the wound to heal, and to aToid a redundancv of"
stems in the crop; and even cut seta should be made green in spring before -
planting.
"Mr. Finnie of Swanston remarked that however well Mr. Smeal's recommendation might suit the culture of the garden, he apprehended that it was inapplicable to the field culture of the potato; as in the field the crop was seldom fit to be raised until the latter half of October, when the risk of frost rendered the exposure of potatoes for a month or six weeks, before they could become sufficiently green, an eminently dangerous experiment. Independently of frost, the large qua ntity of seed-potato required to plant from twenty to forty acres of land, could not be exposed on a field at that late season of the year, without risking the inability to carry them off the field in wet weather, should it set in. And, besides, the occupa- tion of the land by the seed under the proposed process of preparation would prevent its being seed-furrowed for wheat. The greening of seed potatoes may be an effectual remedy against failure; but he did not perceive how the farmer could avail himself of the proposal."
"Dr. Mercer then stated, in reference to the proposed greening process, that having formerly perused Mr. Smeal's paper, and considering the statements of the author as interesting, he had submitted potato tubers, under circumstances similar to what had been described, to a microscopic examination, with a view to find out whether or not any deviation from their normal structure had been induced. He found in those tubers which were completely greened by exposure to the combined influence of the sun and air the colouring matter very generally diffused throughout the parenchyma of the tubers, and it was comparatively dense towards the surface, and around the different germs from the surface to the centre."
"O  The fecula vesicles are fewer in number, though they are much increased in size: and instead of presenting a tissual and entire transparency, they exhibit towards their larger extremity several aggregated granular particles of a greenish colour, and apparently only slightly attached to the inner surface of the wall of their corresponding cell. Many of these cells are found ruptured and empty, and with their contents, especially their pigmentary granules, are scattered throughout the intercellular spaces. The development of these intercellular pigment granules are not found in the potato that has been either blanched or been brought to maturity in well set up-drills; and being unquestionably an adventitious structure, their development, under such circumstances, is only an illustration of the well-known law that prevails elsewhere, that exposure to solar influence and atmospheric agencies is always attended with the development of pigmentary matter. One peculiar circumstance was observed on the application of a pure watery solution of iodine. When a thin section was placed in the field of the microscope, and a drop of solution of iodine was put over it, the coagulation of the liquid contents of the fecula vesicles did not take place, and no blue appearance was produced; but on the addition of a drop of diluted acetic or nitric acid, both of these immediately resulted; and the same effects were produced, without the addition of any acid, provided the cut surface was exposed for a short period to the air.. From this it might be inferred, as Dr. Mercer conceives, that the fecula vesicles, besides forming the usual organic constituents of fecula, also produce at least those of an- other substance, on which apparently the coloration of the colour depends, and which, from its negative influence with iodine, possesses the re-action of an alkaline or alkaloid substance. From the shortness of the time since these investigations were instituted, Dr. Mercer has been unable to obtain any chemical analyses of these matters."
"Mr. Scott of Craigmnie proposed that the directors should refer the subject of this paper to Dr. Mercer, in order that he might investigate it at greater length, and make the results known on a future occasion, for he conceived that something important in reference to the failure of the potato crop might be obtained by the farther pursuit of such an investigation, and the proposal was seconded and supported by Mr. Boyle, younger of Shewalton."

"POTATO CULTURE Farmers Gazette, April 19'"", 1845, page 821"
"From extensive observation and practical experience I find that early planting is a great preventative against failure. Thorough-draining where required—there is little of the surface of our island that does not require it— and deep working all soils is of the first importance; as it admits a free current of air, and enables the fibres of plants to permeate the soil with ease in search of food. When this has been attended to at the proper season—in the end of autumn—it will be easy to get the land early in order for the reception of the potato, which should be all planted before the end of April, when the land is moist, and the bud of the potato in a natural state first appears."
"36  As the early planting will not permit of a thorough pulverization of the land in spring, before the potato has been planted, the width between the drills should be from 30 to 32 inches, to admit the soil being well grubbed and pulverized betwixt the rows. l would recommend that the drills be’ made a good depth ; let dung, which should be moist and well made, by being regularly saturated with liquid manure, be then placed in the drill, and a little soil drawn from the top of the drill to blind the manure before the sets are placed on it. We have found this an excellent plan; it is a more natural element for the potato set, and it can be done with a rake or bush-harrow close behind the spreaders; the whole should be covered as soon as possible with the plough. Employ careful persons to select the seed, laying aside all that have been injured in any manner, never make more than two sets of a potato, cutting off the root end and laying it aside for other purposes, and then split the remainder into halves, so as to have a part of the rose or eye-end in each set. Immediately after cutting, dust the sets with a little gypsum or quick-lime; it helps to prevent the attacks of insects ; and whether dusted or not, allow them to remain before planting two or three days in a cool shaded part quite thinly spread upon the fijor. It has been the general practice for a good number of years back, to get seeds from the higher districts of the county, confirming the opinion, that the less ripe potatoes are they make the better seed; these are failing now also, no doubt, in a great measure, from their not being properly kept in the pit or bin. Every farmer can raise and secure a quantity for seed before they are ripe, when some of the shaws or haulm are beginning to wither, and have them put in a narrow pit 20 feet wide at bottom, with what will heap on that base, a little earth mixed among them, covered with it next to the potatoes, and well thatched with straw, and, besides, run a drain tile along the bottom of the pit, open at both extremities, with some cross ones through the middle of the pit, about 10 feet apart, to secure ventilation. The green ones, or those with a green side, that are on the top of the drills, have been highly recommended by practical men for seed. I got those collected last autumn, and a number of my neighbours advised me to do so; those first gathered have kept well, while the others in the same pit have spoiled a great deal, showing the necessity of having them early collected, as the least frost will destroy them for seed. It has been also advised to have a quantity greened for seed by exposure to the sun and weather; but this will occupy from a month to six weeks, and the risk of frost is so great, that it is a dangerous experiment on a large scale; but a few may be exposed in this way, and those with a green side, on the top of the drills, may be increased by exposing them -while growing, and our seed strengthened by being grown from these. Proper ventilation of the potato-pits or heaps must be attended to, whether for seed or general use; where drain-tiles are not plentiful, two boards, placed one against the"
"other, in the form of a triangle, or as you have seen on the ridge of a house, will suit -"
"very well for placing along and through the pits to give a free current of air, so essential to their preservation. When a change of seed is desirable, it would be advisable that the farmer or his manager should inspect the pits from which they are intended to be taken, to ascertain how they have been kept. In treating the subject of potato culture, I have merely endeavoured to lay down some practical facts. The Highland and Agricultural Society have offered a large premium for the best scientific investigation of the disease in the pox»to, which will call the attention of ourbest chemists to that important subject. ."

"Cc  ON POTATO AND TURNIP CULTURE Farmers Gazette, April 26"", 1845, page 841"
"SiIR—Perhaps the following mode of cultivating potatoes and turnips on the same ground, during the same season, may be"" of interest to some of your readers."
"Some of the earlier sorts of potatoes were selected and planted, in the neighbourhood of Garstang, in ridges ,made by the plough, at the commencement of the present month having got them well sprouted for the purpose before planting. They are planted whole, taking care that the sprout is just covered with earth, that they may have the full bene- fit of the sun; and being about two feet ten inches from centre to centre of the ridges, it is found that they are brought forward faster than if they were planted on the level lands. They are expected to be ready for the market about the end of June, when the ground will be re-ridged and planted with Swedish turnips, having good plants ready for the purpose. This plan has been found to answer and pay remarkably well by many for some years back, not only here but in other parts of England, and is well adapted for either the large or small farmers, when the early potatoes are to be disposed of."
"If this plan is not already adopted in Ireland, by allowing the above a place in your columns, perhaps it might be the means of bringing it more generally into use both in Ireland and England; for if a farmer can get a good crop of potatoes and another of turnips from the same piece of land in one year, I think it very desirable. It matters not whether in the field or the garden; but if in the field, it insures a good crop of wheat the following year."

"IMPROVED CULTIVATION OF THE POTATO Farmers Gazette, May 3rd, 1845, page 7"
"1. DORMANT DISSECTION. — Dormant dissection maybe safely performed upon the potato, so long as the bud in each eye keeps from springing; the best time, however, being in autumn. The time of springing depends much upon the variety, time of ripening, and method of storing in winter. I have seen potatoes in small pits, and late moorland districts, keep dormant till April. As the dormant season, however, is already far spent, I trust not a day will be lost in obtaining seed from late districts. Let the moor farmers drive in the dormant seed now, in mild weather, to the market, and they will assuredly find buyers. Let purchasers cut them immediately, and store them fast in narrow pits, or spare sheds, mixed with a little peat mould, or fresh earth, till planting time. By this means, they become healed over, ready for immediate growth when planted, and thus proved in the pit in place of the field."
"2. POTATO-PLANT SUB-DIVISION. — I need not recapitulate my reasoning from natural analogy, and the experiments already narrated, which, I hold, distinctly bring out"
"38  two new improved modes of potato cultivation. Having briefly explained the first, by showing how the seed can be prepared when dormant, and planted in spring, with the certainty of a regular crop, I shall endeavour to render practicable what I shall in the meantime term potato-plant sub-division. Considering that the season is already far advanced for the first. system, I have the greater hope, that the following will be extensively adopted this season. It may, at first sight, appear to be intricate and expensive; but experience will bring out its simplicity, and the saving of seed alone will pay for extra labour. Let the stable-yard dung be either carted to a sheltered situation in the potato-field, for manure to form a nursing-bed, or let it be spread wide, so as to afford a slight temperature, in a dry sheltered part of the straw-yard. Cover the surface with turf to keep down the steam, then a layer of four inches of peat-earth, leaf-rnould, or loam; above this, pack a layer of whole potatoes, with the crowns up, and four inches of mould alter- nately, till the bed of earth and potatoes be three or more feet in depth. The surface may be covered over with fresh litter as it comes from the stable. They may thus remain till they are pushing up between each other. I have planted ‘such potatoes, several feet sprung, and had a capital crop; but would prefer them, for convenience in the field, from four to six inches in length. It will be observed, that every stem will be furnished with many rootlets, consequently a very small set is quite sufficient to feed the stem till these roots again lay hold of the soil, and the leaves expand into the light, when the sooner the set decays, the better. Every large potato may thus be dissected into eight or ten sets, one stem to each, in place of two to four sets only, and thereby realise a saving of half the usual seed. They ought to be out into open baskets; and while the cutting proceeds, the basket should stand in a tub of thin puddle, composed of soft water and sifted pet earth, cow-dung, and clay; or the lightest of field mould. This pudding is of great advantage in feeding the young spongeal roots, till they lay hold of the soil. They may be either planted with the spade or the plough. If the land has been manured in autumn, the best way is to lay them in every third furrow; but this would require a turn-wrist plough, as the young plant should be laid with the tops northward, and the roots to the south. This is not indispensable; but I have proved,"
"by experiment, that it is an advantage. The only reason that I can give for this is,"
"that when the plant lies at an angle, with the root to the south, the roots and the potatoes receive more benefit from the sun, and are thus rendered larger and of finer quality, than when the potatoes are over-shaded with leaves. Should they be planted in dribs, and manured in the common way, I would give a preference to the turn-wrist plough (although the double one will do well). {I would draw the drills sloping to the north, and put in the manure. Two planters should then carry the basket between them, planting a row each. I would prefer a person following the planters, covering them slightly with a hoe at first, the plough to follow, on the same south side, when the plant appears above ground. By this practice, of having all the root's and potatoes on the southmost side of the drill, a turn-wrist plough can add earth to the roots and tubers as they extend to the south, without injuring or disturbing them, as in the current practice. It ought to be well known to the cultivator, that the roots or feeders of the potato plant all proceed from the very bottom end of the stem; and that all runners on the other hand, that bear potatoes, grow from the buried part of the stem above the roots. I have buried long healthy plants of the potato perpendicularly, and found them unproductive; the feeding roots being I presume, out of the reach of the sun and air; because similar stems, laid nearly horizontal and covered slightly, produced abundant returns, although the stems"
"O  were less luxuriant in some instances. The nearer the buried part of the stem approximates to a horizontal position, when planted, the more acute is the angle where the stem rises perpendicular to the air and light; and the circulating sap can be thus checked, more or less, and thrown into tubers, in place of leaves and over-all stems; it is necessary however, to keep up a proportionate equilibrium of leaves, roots, and potatoes. Thus, weak varieties on poor land, may be planted more upright, while vigorous sorts, that grow too much to straw, on rich land, may be laid in shallow drills, with their tops down the drill if required, to check the sap, and excite the production of additional potatoes from the buried stem. The elements of rich soil, and the exuberance of luxuriant leaves, roots, and steins, may be thus concentrated to the production of increased crops of potatoes in place of potato straw."
"EXPEDITIOUS MODE OF PLANTING POTATOES Farmers Gazette, May 3"", 1845, page 9"
"SIR—I see in this day's paper a remark regarding a speedy way of planting potatoes; and as I have planted, in ten days, twenty-two English acres which I think good work, 1 give you my plan:—"
"I have the field first cleared of weeds and harrowed, so as to leave no obstacle in the way. I keep seven horses at work: two opening and daoBg drills as fast as they can go, the other five drawing eat manure and sets (the manure being principally in the field). I put two men to assist the cart-men in filling the carts, so as to occasion no delay. I keep also two men in the field, to assist in unloading, one working at each hind corner of the cart, The driver, standing in the cart, with his grape (fork), throws the dung into the middle driil—the two others manuring their respective drills on each side of him. Three drills are thus dunged, while the horse is slowly moving onwards. After them I have three women spreading the grapefuls thus deposited; and three more dropping the potatoes about t*o inches apart. I have in this way, in, one day, put in nearly three English acres—the one pair of horses opening and closing. The great thing is, to have all things ready before commencing, so that no time I may be lost; and also to have sufficient hands, so as to prevent the horses from being kept unnecessarily idle."
"Yours, &c., A SUBSCRIBER, Lisburn, 27th April, 1546."
"[Nothing is more likely to secure the potatoes against failure, than expedition and dispatch in planting so as to prevent the drills and dung from being scorched with the wind. This object, we think, can be well attained by such an arrangement as our correspondent has made, which we recommend to all, whose circumstances will permit of its being adopted. On this subject, see Mr. Hunter's communication, in this day's paper.]"
"40  AFTER-CULTURE OF DRILL POTATOES Farmers Gazette, May 3%, 1845, page 10"
"Sir - The after-culture of drill potatoes is usually done by paring or cutting the drill, at each side of the plant, and within three inches of it; then the drill-harrow and roller, if necessary, are applied, to break any lumps the harrow may bring to the surface; weeding, &c., is then performed; the fine earth is then put to the potatoes, by a double moulding-plough; this operation is again executed, when the work is finished. It is after this fashion that all the practical farmers act, that I know of, with the exception of one, who, I admit, 1s entitled to take the first place, as a really practical and successful agriculturist. __ His plan is not to pare or cut his drills, but to cut the centre between them; and then put the earth up to the plant. His reason for not cutting is, not to injure or disturb the roots; but he takes great pains in hoeing and weeding."
"It may be, that some information can be supplied through the columns of the GAZETTE on this practice; and perhaps you might favour the public with your - own observations, on the relative merits of both plans."
"Yours, &c., LUMPER, 30th April, 1845"
"[In the course of our practice, we never had the earth cut away from the drill, unless by the coulters of the scarafier; and this we consider necessary, in order to have the ground properly cleared, and kept loose and open for the admission of air. This can be done with safety, in the early stages of the plant, before the roots have extended themselves; yet we consider a distance of three inches from the plant too little, as the manure would be liable to be dragged out and the sets displaced, Six inches on each side of the plant, will be near enough in the first instance; and in our succeeding application of the implement, it must be contracted according to the increased space occupied by the roots.]"

"Having seen a few observations in thy last number on the after-culture of potatoes; and as my practice is, in some respects, different, and in my own opinion, of course, in some respects better, I shall give a short outline of my plan; or perhaps I may be allowed to go a little back, and commence with the stubble-ridge. I begin with a light ploughing, immediately after the harvest has fully begun, between the rows of stooks, having the grain stooked on about every seventh ridge, and the remainder when the grain is removed. In this way six-sevenths of the field can be proceeded with, and harrowed as soon as it is dry, generally in a day or two. |"
"O  have the harrow so constructed as to stop at regular intervals to drop any weeds collected, which are afterwards carried off for bedding, which, at that season of the year, is sometimes not too plenty. When this stands two or three days, to kill any weeds, I then commence with my convertible grubber a description of which appeared in the GAZETTE of 15th of 6th month (June, 1844), and which, in my opinion, is the best adapted for general agricultural purposes of anything of the kind I ever met with,—although I have examined several of the most extensive agricultural implement manufactories in Ireland.—both for strength, improved form of teeth, its being convertible into so many different purposes, &c., at a small additional expense. The first cost of the implement itself now, since the rise in the price of iron, would be, for two horses, about £3, for three horses, £3 15s. As some of thy correspondents were inquiring about grubbers some time ago, I have been induced to make these observations. I may further add, that an acquaintance of mine near Dublin has applied to me to procure him one, which can be applied to the purposes of potato harrow, scuffle, drill grubber, common grubber, wheat drill, and double mould-board plough. It can also be applied to striping and putting up potatoes at the one operation, and at one going through; and, lastly, in my opinion one of its very best points, it is uncommonly well adapted for the purpose of a subsoil-plough for two, three, or even four horses, in all soils that are not much infested with large stones. To this last point I could not speak so positively last year, not having had much trial of it at that time; but it is my opinion that in soils of the abode description three horses will do the work almost as well as five, and decidedly better than four, with the subsoil-plough—of course having two or three horses opening with the common plough. When it is made, I intend to request my friend to show it to thee, as the model which I sent up was but an imperfect one, having to be made in such a hurry. The cost of the above would be about £5 or £6, or perhaps a little more, in consequence of the rise in the price of iron."
"Hoping this may not be an unprofitable digression, I shall proceed. Having harrowed the ground at harvest as soon as ploughed, I then commence with the grubber, giving each nine-foot ridge from three to five or six turns, taking in two ridges at a time, having the grubber to follow the furrow horse, ending with the hand horse in the centre furrow, which leaves the ridges without any tracks, and consequently in a better state to receive the beneficial effects of the weather. I then, in the course of a few days, harrow it again to collect the weeds that may be brought to the surface, when it may stand for a week or two to cause any seed weeds to vegetate, or a month or two if no sooner opportunity appears. I then begin to plough every two ridges into one, which leaves more room for properly opening and proceeding with the work, first running the grubber in the bottom of each furrow, then the common plough follows, and the grubber the same as the subsoil-plough. When the ground is all finished in this way, I leave it to spring, when I again run the grubber over it as soon as the weather is favourable; this retards the growth of weeds and loosens it up again to the fresh action of the atmosphere—across the ridges is the best, as it cuts the furrows better. Before grubbing I give it a stroke of the harrow, which causes it to mould better. If it contains tap-rooted weeds or coltsfoot, it may be necessary to plough it, otherwise a reverse stroke of the grubber may be sufficient. I then proceed to drill it up with the double mould-board plough, covering the potatoes with the same; the method I pursue is to take in a second row at the lower end of the field,"
"42  closing the two rows from the upper end, which does the work much more effectually than by taking a fresh row each time, this, I suppose, is familiar to most, but perhaps not all. In covering I go as deep as the horses are well able, leaving the rows in this way for a few days that all seed weed's may vegetate or others die. I then proceed to cut up the furrows with the grubber with three teeth if two horses are employed, with five if three horses; if three teeth are used, I set them at a wide distance to cut the outsides, and then close it a little, and go another time, after which if there be any tops on the rows, I run a light harrow to kill any seed weeds, and to flatten the tops. I then run the plough again through them, having the mould-boards close set, or sometimes only one which 1 think best where it has been thoroughly loosened, and which may be done in the manner described to the depth of twelve or fourteen inches ; after having stood for a few days to dig and kill any weeds, I again harrow it down, and thus leave them longer or shorter as the weather, &c., may seem to require, or till they might be about six inches long, when I could again run through them with the grubber and plough with perhaps no mould-board at all, as I found it not to require any, having just a little rubbish between the handles of the common plough, being always particular to work the ground in dry weather. This is an outline of my practice, and how far it is in error I leave with thee and thy correspondent to judge.—"

"THE CULTIVATION OF BANGOR POTATOES Farmers Gazette, May 10"", 1845, page 27"
"siR—I have been for some days in the early part of this week with a friend in the country; and in our walks through his farm, observed a field of, I suppose, three acres, planted with Bangor potatoes, in lazy beds; it had been an old lea, and the potatoes were planted before Christmas, manured with sea-rock. My attention was directed particularly to this field, by observing two men raking the surface of the ridges into the furrows. I remarked to my friend—"" You, of course, intend that all the soil now removed by the rake, shall again be replaced by the shovel. His reply was—"" By no means, as that description of potato, not growing to the surface like the pink eye and cup potato, does not require to be second covered."" This mode of culture being so different from what I had been accustomed to with regard to potatoes, determined me to make you acquainted with it, in hopes that should it be the best mode of culture, you would, by publishing this letter, give information to others on the subject; or if the contrary, you would draw attention to it in your next publication, in such a manner as may promote the object you have so constantly in view, namely, the improvement of husbandry in general.—"
"Yours, &¢., IGNORAMUS, Dublin, May 3, 1845."
"[It is a common saying amongst farmers, that potatoes require the earth to be drawn towards their roots, during their growth; and that turnips grow better when it is drawn away from them: but from our correspondent's communication it appears that Bangor potatoes are an exception to this rule, and that their roots require to be"
"O  lightly covered with soil; this may arise from their tendency to grow downwards, which seems to be the case with all varieties of potatoes, which produce large tops: this downward tendency, by carrying the roots beneath the influence of air, and bringing them in contact with cold moist earth, must act injuriously and retard the growth of the plant. The practice, therefore, of removing part of the soil for the purpose of keeping the fibres nearer the surface, is one which under such circumstances, will be likely to prove beneficial. Perhaps some of our readers may be able to supply a few facts regarding the cultivation of the potato above alluded to.]"
"PREPARATION OF SEED POTATOES Farmers Gazette, May 47°, 1845, page 42"
"siR—Observing a well-written article on the preparing of seed potatoes previous to planting, in your journal, I beg leave to state my plan of operation."
"In the autumn, when raising the potato crop, I invariably select all the small potatoes, which are generally given to piss, &c., and make them up in a long, narrow pit, covering them well with earth, leaving air-holes in both sides in case of any heat taking place; and after leaving them so for a month, I shut up the holes until the spring, when I house them (generally about the month of February). Before they begin to bud, spread them as thin as possible, and turn them. If they have a disposition to grow before I can conveniently plant them out, I again pick them over, and throw aside any potatoes that may appear doubtful; and, when ready for planting, set them in the drills twenty-seven inches wide, and about ten inches from set to set. By adopting this plan, I have never had a single failure. I invariably have the dung in the field ready to put into the drills; and one plough opens and another covers them in, so that probably not more than twenty minutes elapse after the dung is filled from the heap, until it is spread, and the potatoes planted and covered in: the shorter the time between the filling and covering, so much less is the loss sustained by the dung. I invariably find that potatoes planted whole, are ten days above ground before the cut seed; and. although not so large in size, produce a far heavier and more abundant crop; besides, the whole potato is not nearly so liable to be destroyed by worms or slugs, or even a long course of dry weather, as those that are cut.—"
"Yours, &c., A. S., Kanturk, May 9, 1845."
"ON THE CULTURE OF THE BANGOR POTATO Farmers Gazette, May 17'"", 1845, page 42"
Sir - In your GAZETTE of Saturday last there is a method or cultivating the Bangor potato winch is alleged to be new. I am afraid there are too
"44  many new fashions now-a-days set forward in agriculture, some of which are only calculated to lead the young farmer astray, and put him both to unnecessary trouble and expense. I have seen both kidney and Bangor potatoes planted before Christmas, and an extra cover of earth put on in order to protect them from the frost, which was removed in the spring to suffer the potatoes to shoot up freely, and be within reach of air and heat. I - never could perceive that the Bangor potato had a tendency to grow lower in the earth than the kidney or other early potatoes; but I have often found them shooting the tubers both through the top and sides of the drill, about which I may here give you some account. In the spring of 1828, I sowed an acre of Bangor potatoes in the neighbourhood of Roscrea, county Tipperary, in drills. The drills were made three feet wide, and the- sets were planted in the rows twelve inches apart. In the course of the summer, and after the potatoes were earthed up (although I had a first-rate double mould plough, and the drills finished off in the best possible manner), about ten or twelve days, I had to put men through them with shovel to cover the young potatoes up, and prevent them from being injured by the sun. When the digging season commenced, the labourers who were not in the habit of seeing such large drills, asked me to weigh seven drills (the length of the drills were thirteen perches) each square perch weighed 25 stones, or at the rate of 200 barrels per acre. There were other kinds of potatoes in the same field, all treated in the same manner, andequally good in appearance, but none were weighed except the Bangor. I have to observe, that there appeared to be a perch or two of ground where the cup potatoes were planted, that seemed to take the lead of all the rest of the field throughout the summer: this was found to be occasioned by a load of fern dung taken from the bottom of a haycock.—"
"Yours, &¢., M.H., Callan, April, 1845."
"[We presume that the gentleman to whose communication our correspondent refers, had forgot to ask his friend who adopted the plan alluded to, whether or not in so doing he was not merely following the common practice to which reference is made above, and which of course is necessary when a large quantity of earth has been laid over the beds or drills to protect the early planted potatoes from the frost. Perhaps he will be kind enough to state whether there had been an extra quantity of earth laid on the potatoes or not.]"
"THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE AND FAILURE OF THE POTATO CHOP EXPLAINED, WITH A PROPOSED REMEDY"
"Farmers Gazette, May 31°', 1845, pages 68-69"
"As to the early history of the potato plant, it appears to have been imported into Ireland from South America more than 200 years ago, and introduced into this country from Ireland about the year 1740, which was a year of scarcity, when a, few were brought over to Scotland: but their culture was then confined to the garden, till about the year 1753 or 1754, when they were raised in the field: the plant has not been extensively cultivated in this country more than seventy years. There are great varieties of the potato: and the kinds first known in this"
"O  quarter were the kidneys, the leather coat (called from the roughness of its skin), the blackamore (that is the dark-coloured Virginian), and the killimancas (query, the dons), which appears to have been a cross betwixt the white and red. The prevailing kinds in our day are, the kidney, Perthshire reds, dons, and buffs; the two latter being at present most extensively planted in this neighbourhood. There is also another species called the Surinam, or hog- potato, or yam; this variety is not eaten by the human species, at least in this country, but it has two valuable properties to recommend it, as very productive, and has never yet been known to fail; as also the American early, which always succeeds."
"In accounting for the disease of the potato, I do not pretend to give a scientific or chemical analysis of the diseased plant; I leave this to Professor Johnston and the chemists, who, I have no doubt, will be able to throw additional light on the subject. All, then, that I mean to propose is, to point out the evident cause of failure (derived from a long practical experience in the cultivation of the plant), and the means of preserving and procuring good seed; and hence to make sure of raising a good and sound crop. There seems to have been a general failure of the potato-crop at different periods of its history, not only in the British islands, but particularly on the continent of Europe, and also in America. The failure seems to have been almost universal; and, indeed, something like an epidemic in the animal species has at various periods almost laid waste the potato-fields. I have no doubt that such was the cause that a peculiar season, along with improper cultivation and management, had produced such effects. The first symptom of degeneracy of the plant in Scotland appeared about the year 1780, when the distemper, called the curl, first exhibited itself but it then oc- curred so rarely, that very little notice was taken of it; but the evil gradually and extensively increased, when, about the year 1784-5, the whole crops of the Lothians were seriously affected by it. A remedy, however, was accidentally discovered, by changing the seed from the high country; and this was, and has been, the only remedy for the disease of the curl to the present day. At this early period, the seed procured from the high country had to be changed every three or four years; but it was found, as the cultivation of the plant increased so did this disease; and from about the year 1620 up to the year 1835, it was customary to change the seed every other year; and from 1835, to the present year 1845, the whole seed had to be changed yearly as it was found that a new disease appeared in the fields; the seed only _ partially germinated—great failures took place—and many farmers almost lost their whole crops. This disease in the seed was called the wet and dry rot; and, in many instances, seed from all situations, high and low, has now also failed. Yes, seed from old grass-lands, in a high situation, low temperature -and an excellent crop, and which had never been known to have grown a potato-crop, the produce, as seed, has signally failed; and many instances can be attested where, in newly improved lands, in high situations and which had never been previously been cropped, immense crops of potatoes, has produced but have been found utterly worthless as seed, and the disease always the same, partially curl, and blind eyes as they are producing wet and dry rot. These two kinds of disease which destroy germination, called the wet and dry rot are variously accounted for. Some ascribe the problem to maggots and flies which feed upon and destroy the seed plants; but this is a consequence, and not the cause; for"
"46  maggots or flies are only to be found on diseased or putrid vegetables: they riot and thrive on putrefaction. it is their natural food, and there they are only to found. Plant, then, a sound potato ina good soil, and properly treated, it will find it’s way to surface, and produce a good crop in defiance of all maggots and flies. The seeds of disease, then, must be in the constitution of the plant, else they will not-touch it. In examining a diseased potato, which has, as commonly called, blind eyes, and will not germinate, it is plain that there is’ canker on the skin and plague spots all over it. This, if planted will certainly be _ attacked by the maggots am flies: but the plant is in a state of decay or putrefaction—in fact caput mortuum—and it properly belongs to the flies and maggots by right of inheritance. The great object to be attained, then, is to plant sound seed, and the maggots and flies will not relish it. As the crops on the high lands are early checked by frost, and the tops or haulm soon destroyed, they do not fully ripen; and this circumstance has induced farmers in the low districts to take up their crops for seed in a green or unripe state, in order to imitate the operations of nature on the hill grounds; but this plan has also failed. Seed has been often raised from the apple, but in two or three years it curls and degenerates. It is now generally allowed, and the idea long entertained, that it is quite possible to raise seed-potatoes without being affected with curl in the low situation, or in a high temperature free of degeneracy or curl: but at an altitude of 400 feet, it then entirely disappears. In this there appears to be a verv remarkable peculiarity in the nature and constitution of the plant; but in looking to its origin, general history, cultivation, and general management in this country— its success and failure—l have been led to a far different conclusion. Indeed, from what I have already stated it must clearly appear to every one, that there can be only one cause for the failure of the plant, viz., over-cultivation. The crop too often repeated on the same soil, and too much stimulus applied to the plant, has weakened or destroyed its vital energies, and rendered it incapable of reproduction. In the cultivation and general management of the plant, we have entirely lost sight of nature, which always follows the moderate or middle course; and, by a long train of mismanagement, we have nearly lost this most valuable root; and if we shall persist much longer in following the present unnatural and inconsiderate course of treating it, we shall certainly lose it. I may ask, who can contemplate a luxuriant crop of growing potatoes in full bloom, standing like a forest of pines, but must reflect on the immense stimulus applied to produce such amass of stem, foliage, and blossom, and, at the same time, how much the roots or tubers must be enfeebled and exhausted in producing it? The first practical experience of failure which I met with on my own farm struck me most forcibly. In the year 1837, I had a small quantity of potatoes for seed, which I had received from the high grounds (the farm of Bonally, in the high part of the parish of Colinton). I thought them very fine; and having selected the best for seed, I manured the ground heavily in the drill with the richest and best dnug on the farm, in order to have as many as possible for planting the succeeding year. The extent of ground was about an acre, and I certainly obtained an excellent crop; but as I never planted a whole field in the same way without some variation, by way of experiment, I planted a few drills of similar seed next to them, very moderately manured, and at the time of taking up the crop, this acre was still green in the tops, and we commenced to take up the crop at the opposite side of the field, leaving them the last to be taken up. The few drills already mentioned were pitted on the end of a pit not meant for"
"O  seed, and the produce of the acre was pitted by themselves. Next season I planted the greater part of the produce of the acre in the ordinary way, and lost one-third of the crop. I also planted the produce of the few drills in the ordinary way, and had a little curl, but not a single blank. I was very particular in all the operations of pitting and cutting, and I am quite sure that the seed was not injured in that way: In looking round me, I found that all my neighbours ha suffered in proportion to the condition of their farms; and what puzzled me most"
"were the many contradictory opinions and statements. The truth is, that blanks in the fields, or partial failures of the crops, were maintained by some to be quite un- accountable, and some of Nature's freaks when she was inclined to be mischievous; such as, part of the crop so different—and planted at different times of the day—one hoar's planting had failed and become blank—while the others were a fair crop, I can easily conceive, however, that degenerate or delicate seed could be easily injured when planted in very dry or wet ground, or by any exposure or variation of temperature. A few drills not covered by the plough, when the weather was too dry, and the plants exposed to the sun and air during the time of the servant's breakfast or dinner, was quite sufficient to produce failures or blanks in the drills. I now cose to state an Instance, and one of many that can be adduced, which most clearly and satisfactorily, supports my assertion, viz., that a heavy crop, grown in any situation or soil, will always be found to produce, in a certain degree, degenerate and tainted seed. The following is a letter which I lately received from Mr. Cunninghame, tenant, Barlow, in the parish of Currie. This farm is situated near the foot of the Pentland Hills, at an elevation of more than 500 feet above the level of the sea. Mr. Cunninghame was born and bred on the farm (his late father being the proprietor). He is well known by his improvements of the plough, &c.; and he is very particular and careful in all his farming operations, taking a great interest in them, personally superintending ail the operations; and I may also add, that his statements can be implicitly depended on. The experiment (if may call it one) may have been more minutely described; but as the broad feature of the case—the cause of failure—is what I aim at, it is of much less importance. It may be asked, how is the failure now so universal under all systems of management, even extending to the uplands ? I answer, that the system of management is now nearly alike in all places, soils and situations, both at home and abroad; that the cultivator of the root finds that excessive manuring produces heavy crops; and the same pernicious system is now followed by the hill-farmers, as many find the seed-trade a profitable one; and the quantity cannot be increased without the requisite stimulus—the dunghill; and the late discovered measures have enabled them to increase their stock of manure for the potato crop."
"A Paper by A. Patullo, Esq. of Bellneld Villa, Edinburgh, Scotland The following is a copy of Mr. Cunninghame's lettter:—"
"MY DEAR SIR—The new land in the Bog-Park was never in crop in my remembrance, either white or green. I drained the land every furrow; they were old round-about ridges. I ploughed the land, and part of it I sowed with oats, and harrowed the potato land along with what was intended for oats. In the spring of last year—about the end of April, the 20th or 24th of the month—I employed two men to plant them, and put them in with the spade ; they put the"
"48  line across the furrows, and made a, rut on each side of the line ; turned out the sod, put in the dung about twelve tons per acre, and then returned the sod. I employed a boy with a hoe after them, to blind any of the chinks; and after the crop was well brairded, I dug or rather scraped with a spade betwixt, the drills, which were twenty-eight inches wide, and about twenty days after I drew. the scrapings to the plants with a hoe. I measured several drills at lifting-time, and the"
produce was nearly as possible 100 bolls per acre. I planted one drill with Irish
"cups, and the crop was good; one drill with buffs—they were also good; one drill of reds, from Ratho (the low country), which turned out a bad crop; the rest was from Biggar-shiel, all dons. My other potatoes were planted in the field adjoining. About the middle of May I gave them about twenty tons of dung per acre. I began about the first week of October to lift them, and lifted the bog-crop first; they were all pitted on the same plan; the pits about four feet wide, and about five inches taken out of the bottom, the potatoes put in, covered with straw, and afterwards about four inches of earth. I put in wooden ventilators, square boxes made of paling-rail, with openings at the bottom, about two feet down amongst the potatoes, and the other end above the pit. I let them (the ventilators) stand this way for four or five weeks, and then put on about ten inches of earth: as soon as I saw an appearance of frost I stopped them with straw. I may add, that the boxes ran short, and I finished with straw, which seemed equally well to answer the purpose. I have just put the last of the potatoes in the barn to-day, to cut for seed. Those from the new land and great crop do not appear to be so good seed as my other potatoes, which were not half the crop; there seems to be more blind-eyes amongst them. My going or cropping land has lain twice in pasture during the last fifteen years. I do not think it possible that ant of the seed which I planted could be heated after cutting; and I had no opportunity of knowing whether those planted had been heated before I received them: of course, they hane not been heated this season. I forgot to mention that the bog-land, before draining, was all naturally wet. The reason I gave it so little manure was, that the cattle had lain in that part of the field, and the land was enriched from that circumstance"
"lam, &c., JOHN CUNNINGHAME, Harlaw, May 5, 1845."
"P.S.—My brother at Kenleith got some seed potatoes from the west, country— nine bolls from new land, and one from going or cropping land—and he says, that the latter is the best seed, having fewer blind-eyes."
"The above completely confirms what I have already advanced, viz., that. a heavy or overgrown crop of potatoes, in any soil or situation, will always yield bad seed potatoes; and that over-cultivation is the -sole or chief cause of the degeneracy of the plant. As an exception to this rule, it is mentioned in the Quarterly Journal of the Highand Society, No. 4, and in the Farmer's Note-Book, No. 4, extracted from a German work, published by Dr. Sprengel “that the cultivation of the potato is one of the principal objects of farming in the vicinity of Hamburgh, and the growing of corn a secondary object; and as this is particularly the casei n Flotbeck, that no such case of failure has occurred. It has happened several times in wet weather that the seed putrefied; and even when the potatoes had not suffered in this way when planted out, not half of them germinated ; while those that did, were sickly and a poor crop."" Now, what was this, but the same cause of"
"O  faiture—the wet and dry rot? And the Hamburgh farmers are obliged to change the seed yearly from Holland, East Friesland, and the marshy districts of Hamburgh. The Hamburgh farmers have, then, pursued the course of the Lothian farmers and others, and are obliged yearly to change the seed. It will be found that diseased seed will produce bad or diseased crops; and that near shipping ports the potatoes will be carried, by our shipping and others, in small quantities to all parts of the world; and hence increasing the evil; the more especially as the great bulk of the crop is produced in the highly-cultivated districts where the seed will be most deteriorated. It seems self-evident, then, that the crop first degenerated in the rich and cultivated districts of the low country, producing curl in the plant; that as the cultivation of it increased, the curl increased, and a change of seed was found necessary from the high country; that within these ten years past, in addition to curl, blanks or entire failure of the plant has taken place in our fields, and the disease of curl, and the complete or partial failure, has kept pace with the cultivation of the plant, and in the exact quantity of stimulants or manure applied; and that the first blanks in the fields have appeared to have continued since the manure has been so much increased to the crops viz., during the last years, the quantity of manure applied to the crop having been increased one forth generally all over the country, as the increased quantity of manure (when the crop has succeeded) has in a very remarkable degree increased the return, to the extent, in many cases, of one-third more potatoes; and in some instances the crop has been doubled. But as the crop is increased in quantity, so does it decrease in quality: and very nearly in the same ratio. The potato is a native of a warm climate; and I am fully impressed with the idea that it should thrive best in an early soil, and in warm and sheltered situations, allowing it at the same time sun and air; and whoever has observed the immense crops raised in the low country, the superior quality of the produce, and the vigorous growth of the plant in almost all early soils, must come to this conclusion; although, at the same time, I will allow that a change of seed from the high grounds, and from every variety of soil and climate, may still be of advantage to the farmer of both the high and low districts of the country. That the plant has continued longer in the hill-districts free of curl and failure, is no argument against my theory, as it is the poverty of the soil and the want of manure that have saved it. it not only has received less manure—for they have little to give it but it has not received at its root so much of that heating and stimulating article, horse-dung or stable-manure, which I attribute as the cause of assisting materially in the deterioration of the root. The crops, also, until of late years, have not been so often repeated on the same soil; and a change of crop is of great advantage to the health and well-being of any plant."
"I come now to the cure or remedy of the disease or the best means of procuring and raising good seed—as I do not yet despair of seeing good seed, and the best that can be raised, to be found in the early and highly-cultivated districts. It must, of course, be obvious to all, that, if possible, seed should be obtained from South America; but as it would not be possible to procure more than a very limited quantity, we ought to try what can be done to improve those of “our own country. I would recommend to select the best varieties, and raise from the apple; but, in the meantime, to have the best and soundest seed for present planting—always, of course, avoiding the produce of a great crop, grown in any situation or soil. The land intended tar seed should be ploughed deep in the autumn, and, if possible, by the trench-plough. The"
"50  drills to be thirty inches wide, and manured moderately with, if possible, a mixture of"
"earth; and if earth be not previously mixed with the manure, a little may be drawn into the drills above the manure, and before planting the seed. Mr. Dickson Sanghton, near Edinburgh, who has been very successful m raising good crops of potatoes, is very judiciously, this year, mixing all the manure intended for potatoes with earth. The ground intended for seed should be planted with whole potatoes, and about fourteen inches apart; or the potato cut in two, and planted at ten inches (both may be tried), the plants to be placed near the surface, and never highly earthed up by the plough, as it is natural for the tubers of the plant to run upwards; and the more of them, in ripening, that may be exposed to the sun and air (greened), they will make so much the better seen. To be taken up rather green or unripe than other- ‘wise, but approaching to a ripe state. To be placed in pits (in any airy situation), at about 2 and a half feet at bottom: they may be carried up pretty high, and the pits may be made of a tolerable length. They should have first a little earth thrown over them—say half an inch—and then a good covering of straw, finishing with a few inches deep of earth, as it is the straw which will defend them from frost; and a few straw funnels, at short distances, is all that is necessary. The seed potato should be planted by the first of May at farthest. In the late districts, as the seed may be injured by the frost before taken up, they could be well earthed up by the plough a short time before the frost may be expected; and the same may be done ‘in the low country; but of course they do not run an equal risk so early in the season, although we all know that a very slight degree of frost will injure the potato. Those not meant for seed ought to be managed much in the same way; giving the land, however, more manure, and planting’ deeper; as the potato, if greened, will, of course, be unfit for food. I would advise the experiment of topping or cutting the potato tops when too luxuriant. It may be done in this way:—A person, with a common harvest reaping-hook, about the time of the decay of the blossom, should be employed to go along the drills and cut off the tops, about two inches or so below the blossom; this will not only prevent them seeding, but will check the luxuriance of the stems, and save the exhausted roots or tubers. I have always thought that the produce of any overgrown or luxuriant white crop produced inferior seed; and I suspect it will be found that all white and green crops may be too highly cultivated. It is well known that turnip roots rot and decay prematurely from the application of too much manure. I have also long entertained the idea, that smut in wheat, barley, and oats, has always arisen from over- cultivation; and if we shall find out the cause, we can have less difficulty in finding a remedy. I therefore, hope that agriculturists will assist me m exploring the field of over-cultivation, which has seldom or never been thought of, as almost every farmer has gone on upon the principle, that too much stimulus could not be applied: the crop may have been too luxuriant to be profitable, but the degeneracy of the seed or root has been invariably lost sight of. We must, then, bear in mind, that Dame Nature may be assisted or followed with success; but if we shall attempt to deviate from her law, we are sure to fail. :"
"Note.—The author of "" The Problem Solved,"" in a very ingenious treatise on the subject, has pointed out the probable effects of cutting the potato in the spring or bleeding season, and also on producing and raising seed from the apple. In planting the potato whole, of course this objection would be obviated."
"I have mentioned that the American early, and the Surinam potato, or yam, have not been known to fail. Neither of these has been extensively cultivated; and al-"
"©  though not an absolute failure, yet it is well known that they have degenerated; and the yam, from this and other causes, has nearly disappeared from our fields. My plea is that long-continued and extensive cultivation will finally destroy the plant; and the Surinam and American early form no exception to the theory advanced."
"STORING POTATOES Farmers Gazette, June 7'"", 1845, pages 92-93"
"Bleeding is the vital cause of disease in the potato, but their constitutional vigour is also impaired by bad treatment in storing, &c. They are cuffed with the fork in lifting, tossed into the cart, and out of the cart, more like stones than living vegetables. It should always be borne in mind, that potatoes should be handled more like eggs than stones, both for the sake of their affording wholesome food and good seed. They are very easily bruised; and bruises give out putrefying gases, that soon dissolve the whole mass into rottenness. They should, if possible, be lifted dry, and stored into narrow pits, on the surface of dry ground. They ought to be partially mixed with peat mould or dry earth in pitting, and covered on the surface with the same. Straw should never be laid next to the potatoes, for if rottenness commences, straw is sure to rot also, and increase the mass of putrefaction; whereas mould will act as a preservative. They should not be immediately covered thick over with earth, as is usually done; but ought to sweat a week or ten days, with only a slight covering of litter, or potato haulm, to keep the rain out, For late table use, they should again be stripped when they begin to bud, and turned over, removing any rotten ones and bruising the tops of the buds. They should again be allowed to sweat, and treated as in the first pitting. It always ought to be remembered, that the potato is a living vegetable and in whatever stage it exists, it gives out less or more heat. They should never be stored in large heaps, without facilities for ventilation in suitable weather."
"I would suggest, that long pits might be more successfully ventilated, by having triangular wooden pipes, made of three narrow boards, to rest close on the top of the ridge of potatoes, and perforated with holes on the flat side, in contact with the potatoes, so as to receive the heated air, to be carried off by little chimneys rising above the pit. The condensed air would thus readily pass off, as it became expanded by the heat of vegetation. Dr. Weir, of Galashiels, is very successful in preserving table potatoes till an advanced season, by storing them in barrels among sawdust."
"I have found those left in the garden-ground, where they grew, and also those preserved in small lots among peat mould, produce a much better crop than the same stock from a pit or bin. I would therefore urge, that potatoes for seed ought to be stored in small lots, or very narrow pits, well ventilated, and that they should be mixed with a considerable portion of dry peat mould, from the vicinity of undecayed bog oak. Such preservative mould invigorates weak seed, more than leaving it in the ground. It is a slovenly system to leave seed potatoes in"

I have found ferns have the effect of preventing mice, by first covering two inches with mould, then a few ferns, mould, &C. A little soot, mixed with mould, through the pit, also prevents worms and small insects from boring the potato; but I have not yet discovered what effect it has on the seed, &c. Our agricultural chemists might surely suggest something to mix with, preserve, and check the growth of table potatoes, such as salt mixed sparingly with the mould, &C,—"

"ON POTATO PLANTING AND FAILURES Farmers Gazette, July 19'"", 1845, pages 183-184"
"When so many contradictory opinions are put forth in every agricultural periodical, each one professing to point out the true cause of potato failures, one feels hesitation in advancing anything upon so intricate a question. Having, however, adopted a new and very successful mode of cultivating that valuable esculent, l cannot be blamed for making it public, in the hope that it may be further tested by experiment."
"A field of six Scotch acres, from which a heavy crop of wheat had just been carried, was covered with dung at the rate of fifty carts per acre, and immediately ploughed in with a deep furrow across the slope, in which state it was left all the winter. The soil was a pretty strong clay, but being thoroughly drained and laid level, the water neither ran along the surface nor stood upon it Early in April it was harrowed, grubbed, and, without further preparation, drilled for potatoes, being perfectly clean, rich, and mellow, to the depth of ten inches, to which depth the dung had been ploughed in. The potatoes, consisting of red and white dons, and other kinds most subject to failure, were cut about the beginning of March into sets of one eye each, and some with two eyes each, spread out upon the barn floor and sprinkled with powdered gypsum. Six weeks after this (12th April) they were planted in the drills, drawn not quite so deep as common, as the dung was already mixed with the soil. This completed the operation which has been perfectly successful, the crop being as fine as could be wished, without a failure. The weather at the time of planting was very dry, and the land equally so."
"A considerable time afterwards another field was prepared and planted in the usual way with sixty carts of dung to the acre. There had been abundance of rain— the soil was moist, and the dung was well soaked with liquid manure—the seed was the same as planted in the other field, and treated the same way. Here an extensive failure took place—the seed rotted away from rapid fermentation: it was apparently sound when planted, but on being placed upon fermenting dung it could not but ferment at a rapid pace."
"Now, while I deny that any one has yet found out the true cause of potato failures, I admit that, perhaps, every one who has written on the subject may have pointed out some aggravating circumstance, or predisposing cause; and I may be pardoned for venturing to add one more to the number. I conceive that, owing to"
"O  long forced of cultivation, the constitution of the potato has been impaired—some kinds more, some less. So long as we follow the system that has produced this state of the plant, we shall be liable to failures, although favourable circumstances, in particular cases, may ward off the evil for a time. Where little or no fermenting dung is applied, as in the high country, they may still thrive—and early planting, in all cases, may succeed before the warm weather comes on to induce fermentation. But it ought to be particularly kept in mind, that rapid fermentation produces decay and death, while a gradual process of fermentation is the very cause of life and vigour; every seed or germ must ferment and decay in the very act of giving birth to a plant, but it is the too rapid fermentation that produces consumption and death. The potato in its natural condition ferments slowly upon the approach of spring, sending out vigorous stems at the expense of the gradually-decaying tuber, but if the tuber decays faster than the plant can grow, consumption must take place throughout the whole plant. This state of things has gradually and imperceptibly come on, and the cure must also take time and strict attention."
"In the first place, potatoes should be stored in a dry, cool place, and the external air kept out so as to preserve an equable temperature throughout the winter and spring: they should be cut and planted before fermentation (or growth) takes place, and not upon hot fermenting dung, but on land sufficiently rich by previous preparation, such as ploughing in the dung in autumn ; and I think it consistent with reason and common sense, that the crop should be raised when properly ripened, and stored up in a perfectly dry state."
"This autumn preparation can, of course, only be followed upon clean, dry land; and I need hardly say that the sooner this is attained, the better. It is, moreover, the most economical plan that can be adopted both as to time and labour. One good stirring, when the dung is ploughed in, is perfectly sufficient, as the land is in a highly pulverized state in the spring, and no poaching of cart-wheels takes place in carrying out the dung."
"It has often been remarked that, after a failure has taken place, the land has been replanted with success. Is there any other way of accounting for it than this: that in the first instance the sets were planted upon hot fermenting dung; and in the second, the dung had become cool ? Some of the more hardy kinds will stand even this treatment without injury, but the best kinds are the most delicate."
"There is only one objection that can, with any propriety, be started to the preparing the land in autumn, and it is this: that the more soluble part of the manure will be washed out by the rains daring winter. There may be some truth in it, but it is a point that requires investigation. Light soils may do it more than those that are heavy; and this is another strong argument for deep drains, that the water which carries down the soluble manure must first enrich the whole depth of soil before it can find its way out by the drains, and perhaps enter into combination with various substances in its passage. But admiting all the disadvantages of autumn preparation, they are surely small compared with the renovation and successful cultivation of the potato, so much to be desired."
"I trust I have said enough to induce others to make trial of this plan, and I hope soon to see it generally adopted.—"

"EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT MANURES ON POTATOES Farmers Gazette, July 19'"", 1845, page 186"
"siR—I had some drills of potatoes planted in the beginning of May, in a field which ‘nad been broken up from ley for the same kind of crop last year. They were all treated precisely in the same manner, except in the difference of the manure. applied. To some of them there was fresh lime applied at the rate of 120 barrels of 42 gallons to the Irish acre; to others, guano (Ichaboe), at the rate of 6 cwt. per acre. Some of the guano was mixed with turf-mould (about 1 cwt. of guano to 14 cwt. of turf-mould), and some of it was mixed in the same proportion with ashes left after the fires burned in the house (peat and wood). The potatoes manured with the turf-mould and guano are the most luxuriant I have seen; those with ""the ashes and guano not nearly so fine in appearance, and those with the lime look very"
poorly.

"S$IR—We should, when treating on the subject of thepotato, the roast beef and plum-pudding of poor Paddy - have constant regard to one simple abject; in fact, we should never lose sight, of it, namely, whether the plan we .recommend can be practically and generally carried into affect or not. No one, I am sure, will deny the alarming degree to which the failure of this valuable esculent has extended, and I look upon it as a most meritorious and praiseworthy object - one, not beneath the highest noble in the land, to endeavour, by all and every means in his power, to, at least, counteract the. spread of this calamity. Let us, when on this subject, always bear in mind, that the great bulk of the Irish must, -and in reality do, depend on the potato for their sole subsistence; and that therefore, unless the suggestions we offer, unless, the mode treatment we point out, can be acted upon, can be carried into operation by this class—the potato class of Ireland—Our advice, our plans, our hints, all fall to the ground.

"{am forced to make these few prefatory remarks from having seen, in a late number of the GAZETTE, an article on the potato and its failures. The mode of"
"55  cultivation there set forth is to cover the ground for the potatoes with, dung, at the rate ef 50 carts per acre; this to be done in autumn, The writer must have formed a very erroneous idea of the capability of poor Paddy, in the way of possessing himself of dung. We could not have been aware of the many ways and means resorted to by the poor man to collect, even in the small pit at his cabin door, as much manure as will suffice to plant the rood of early potatoes. Why, it is only about autumn the great mass of the Irish people set about collecting the dung for the following spring; and it is only from Christmas to April that anything worth while is collected. These are facts, and facts that should not be lost sight of in any attempts that are made to introduce a new system of cultivating the potato— the ""thews and sinews"" of the country. As well might we expect that Paddy could lay down an atmospheric line of railroad through his land, as to cover it in autumn with dung, at the rate of 50 carts per acre. Perhaps it may he said that I am one of the old school, and an advocate of the jog-trot, system of farming. No such thing; quite the contrary. I would desire to see many of the old systems (if such they can be called) of farming entirely exploded; but what I war against is the fallacy of attempting to bring this about by means out of the reach of 90 per cent, of our nation. Let our endeavour be, to enable the poor men to raise a good crop of potatoes on his own little patch; let us place within his reach the “modus operandi,” let us, out of our abundance, supply him at a fair price, with good sound seed, if our expensive mode of cultivation has rewarded us with such. Those who plant from 6 to 20 acres of potatoes (and there are many such"") can easily supply their tenants, or their neighbours, with as much sound seed as wiil procure them sound crops in a year or two. I have successfully planted potatoes for the last nine years: I have never had a failure in this crop, in any one of those years; I have extensively distributed my seed potatoes about my neighbourhood up to the present moment; they have grown luxuriantly on holdings hitherto notorious for rotting the potato. I may, at the proper season, point out the successful mode I have, for so many years, followed; it would be rather premature to do so at this season of the year; but in conclusion I will say, that it will be found to be one within the reach of the humblest peasant in the land."

"[The object of the GAZETTE is, to disseminate knowledge on every point, connected with agriculture, and suited to the varied circumstances in which the farmers and cottagers of this country are placed. The article on the autumn manuring of land, as a preventive of potato failure, is, we think, worthy the consideration of every farmer. It would never do to keep such information from the public, merely because certain circumstances prevent its general adoption. It is true that the small farmer, and cottager, have no manure to put on their land at the time recommended in the article referred to; but still this is no reason why those who have, should be denied the benefit of such information. Were small farmers as provident and careful as they might be, their manure heap would be much larger in autumn than it usually is. It is only by showing the necessity of having a plentiful supply of manure, at all seasons, that we can hope to induce them to use the means to provide themselves with it. Our correspondent would be doing a real service to the extensive class of small farmers in Ireland, could he put them in the way of cultivating potatoes, as successfully as he appears to have done himself, for the last nine years, and we think he can not be a day too soon in giving them the benefit of his experience.]"

As a good thing can never come too soon, and if he is bona fide "" PRO BONO PUBLICO,"" as he subscribes himself to be, I think he could have no better opportunity of testifying his merit to the title which he has assumed, than by availing himself of the soundness of your advice. I think he should do so for two very good reasons, both of which are highly interesting to those whom he purposes to furnish with so valuable a piece of information:—"
"The first is, that all who may be ignorant of his ""advice,"" his ""plans,"" and his ""hints,"" may have time to deliberate, and weigh the subject carefully in their minds, before the season arrives at which they shall be expected to set out upon the experiment. The second is, that there may be sufficient time allowed to discuss any subject which the exposition of his doctrine may elicit."
"For my own part, I apprehend from the tenor of his letter that he would require to be cautious, and not be too precipitate in censuring a system, the efficacy of which is now too apparent to be questioned. Perhaps; in his next he will be good enough to give ns his reasons for deprecating the practicability of ploughing in manure immediately after autumn."
"He takes the liberty of using ""Paddys"" name in vain, very often: I should, therefore, suppose he is not one himself; but even though he may not, his information will not be the less welcome. :"

"- commends the ground to be manured in autumn; I beg to say, that I have been a potato grower for the last twenty-seven years, and during all that time have had no failure; simply, from never allowing a knife to be used in my potato house, and sowing only the well-formed small potatoes. I plant them from fourteen to sixteen inches apart, in the lineal direction of the drills. With regard to making manure for autumn use, if the farmer does not house-feed, let him pick up all the droppings in his pasture, every second or third day, and he will soon have a heap, which to have large is the primary step towards perfection in agriculture."

Rust is very prevalent; and many farmers are apprehensive of mildew. Smut is much complained of. This is to be regretted, as the farmer has a remedy in his power, by steeping his seed in pickle, with some blue-stone in it, and mixing with it some slaked lime when taken out of the steep. It is only where this simple remedy has been neglected, that smut has appeared. For the last six years I have adopted it, and have invariably found it a specific against smut."

Under that impression, I am induced to offer for your consideration, and that of my brother farmers, the practice I have so successfully pursued for the last 20 years, viz. :—So soon as the corn is cut off the ground, intended for a future potato garden, it is removed to the head lands, there stooked or stacked, as the case may be, and whatever manure is collected, up to that period, is drawn out, spread in ridges, on the stubble, and ploughed in: thus remaining protected from the influence of the weather until the season arrives for planting, when the ground should be cross-ploughed, harrowed, and drills opened, to receive the seed, "" always the entire potato,"" planted at 16 inches' distance."
"The above is my method of cultivating that most valuable plant; and although the cottager may not possess a horse to plough his land, or put out his manure, perhaps he will not find it difficult to provide a wheelbarrow for the latter purpose, while his spade will cover in the dung as effectually as the plough, and probably with more advantage to the ensuing crop. Should these hints be of service to the small farmer or cottager it will gratify.— :"

"CURE FOR POTATO ROT Farmers Gazette, September 13"", 1845, page 310"
"The great importance of this root, one acre of which will feed more people than three of wheat, makes the present blight a matter of national interest, It seems, from the reports, to be not merely an aggravation of the old potato"
"disease; but a peculiar rot, occasioned by the extraordinary wetness of the ©"
season.
"The old disease has engaged much of the attention of agricultural chemists; and I may have something to say about it, when satisfied with the information collected: but this rot is advancing with such alarming rapidity, that no time is to be lost in attempting to arrest its ravages; leaving the experimental confirmations and improvements to be going on in many places at once."
"Amongst the most effectual preventives and correctives of putrefaction, are chloride of lime, and salt; both quite wholesome, and consisting of elements suitable for manure. For arresting the decay in the ground, a mixture of these—say 1 cwt. chloride of lime, and 3 cwt. salt per acre, may be strewed around the plant, and immediately covered in (for daylight kills the chloride of lime). Or if the weather should happily become dry, it may be applied liquid, at the rate of 1 gallon of water to Ib. of the mixture, upon soil so wet as the present."
"Potatoes dug apparently sound, and subject to rot afterwards, may be first washed in water, and then steeped in the above solution twelve hours (perhaps less time will be found to do). The same liquid will do for many quantities of potatoes, by adding more of the mixed salt and chloride, as they absorb it out: for which the taste may be a sufficient guide."
"The salt should be clean, such as is sold at about Is. 6d. per cwt for agricultural purposes; foul salt would exhaust the purifying quality of the chloride. The chloride of lime (bleaching powder) should be of the very best quality, which is the cheapest for use, as it is a perishable article. The salt should be well mixed with the chloride first, as the latter is apt to curdle in water alone: and no iron or metal of any kind should touch it, either in mixing or in solution, as metals quickly exhaust its qualities—"

"O  ‘THE POTATO GROP Farmers Gazette, September 13"", 1845, page 313"
"The potato crop, so far as our own observations extend is very fine, and entirely free from the dreadful disease which has committed such havoc in the potato fields of Belgium; Holland, and the south of England. Rumours of the disease having broken out in several fields in Ireland, have reached us, but as yet it cannot be said that the plague is at all prevalent. We have seen several fields in which small spots of decayed foliage gave indications that all was not right; yet, upon examination,- the cause could easily be traced to a want of proper drainage; The tubers in these places are certainly beginning to rot, not from disease, which more frequently attacks the drier portions of a field, but from superabundance of moisture. There is seldom a year that premature ripening, to a greater or less extent, occurs in the potato crop in certain localities; this is least observable when the temperature of the season has been uniform, and more so, when there has been sudden transitions from wet to dry, and from cold to heat. The potato possesses a finely organized structure, which is liable to derangement from external circumstances, such as those we have mentioned, and hence its liability to decomposition. Some alarmists take so very gloomy a view of the present potato distemper, as to go the length of prognosticating, that this valuable root is, ere long, doomed to total extinction. For our part, we see nothing more in it than what may be expected to arise from the variable nature of our climate. Similar fears have been, expressed in former years regarding the failure of seed potatoes. Yet, it often happens, capriciously enough, that they will germinate most freely the very year after failures have been most prevalent."
"In cases where the rot has commenced amongst potatoes, no time should be lost in raising them, and separating the good from the bad. The decomposition of animal or vegetable structures is always accelerated by contact with other substances in which it has already commenced; consequently, if the rotten potatoes be allowed to remain in contact with the sound ones, the whole will very soon become a mass of putrefaction. The use of potatoes, even in the incipient stage of decomposition, has proved hurtful to persons who have partaken of them; hence the necessity for exercising the utmost care in separating the good from the bad. Potatoes which are merely discoloured, but not in an active state of decomposition, are unfit for the table; they may, however, be given to pigs with safety, or they may be made into starch, in which state they may be used with impunity. The washing and rasping of the potatoes, in the process of starch-making, will remove all the diseased parts; and the granules will subside, perfectly pure, and free from any putrefactive taint. Those farmers, therefore, who reside in the neighbourhood of starch manufactories, may there get a market for their potatoes, although they be a little tainted. In cases where all the potatoes are diseased, and in an advanced state of decomposition, they should be left as manure; a dose of hot lime would serve to prevent injury to the succeeding crop. When potatoes are to succeed the following year, liming is indispensable, otherwise the taint may be communicated to them from the putrefying matter remaining unchanged in the soil."

"Farmers Gazette, September 27"", 1845, page 343"
"At a meeting of this club, held on Friday, Sept. 13, the lamentable failure of the potato crop formed the principal subject of discussion. In the hope of allaying the alarm which prevails in the neighbourhood respecting the use of potatoes that have become partially injured, and also of suggesting a method by which a large amount of wholesome food may be saved from such as would otherwise be thrown away, or given to pigs, it was resolved that a statement should be circulated, expressing the opinions of the club on these subjects."
1. It appears to be certain that the failure is entirely owing to the season having been unsuited to fully perfecting the tubers of most of the varieties of the potato.
"2. Wherever the leaves and stems are dead, it is advisable to dig up the crop as speedily as possible; and to select the best tubers (to be kept apart from the rest,) for seed potatoes. It is probable there will be a great scarcity when sets will be wanted, unless precautions are pretty generally adopted for saving the best."
"3. The potatoes thus separated for sets should; be preserved with more care than usual. They should be kept as dry as possible, and examined at intervals, to see whether any of them are beginning to decay, and all such should be immediately removed."
4. The spotted and decaying potatoes should be carefully picked out from among such as are to be preserved in store for winter and spring use.
"5. As there is great danger from a single decaying potato being left in contact with others in the same. heap, lest it should tend to rot all around it, care must be taken to stack the store potatoes in layers with sand and dry earth between them, and so that each potato may be prevented from touching its neighbours. A trench might be advantageously dug around the store; and if the whole were thatched it would tend to keep them very dry. It would be advisable to delay the operation of clamping as long as possible, to allow potatoes dry the more thoroughly."
"62  6. The progress of decay in the spotted potatoes may be delayed (at least for some time) by exposing them in dry situations to the light, but their decay will proceed if they are placed in the dark or on moist ground."
"7. If the decaying parts are pared off, or cut out, the rest of the potato is perfectly wholesome. Many idle rumours have prevailed to the contrary, which are unworthy of credit."
"8. If the decaying potatoes have not passed to a state of putridity, they may be safely given to pigs: but they would be improved by being scalded, with the addition of a little salt. -"
"9. It seems to be a providential arrangement, that as yet the really nutritive portion of the potato is very little injured, even in those tubers which have become partially decayed, and appear to be wholly unfit for food; the nutritious portion of the potato. consists of delicate white grains of starch-like matter, which are enclosed in little cells. When the cells are broken the grains fall out, and, collecting together, form a beautifully white flour. It is very easy to separate this flour from the rest of the substance of the potato: and if a few persons in dif- ferent villages would undertake to make the method generally known among the poor, a vast amount of wholesome rood may yet be secured for them, which otherwise they will suffer to perish. From an experiment that has been tried during the past week, it appears that where 12 Ibs. of flour can be extracted from a bushel of sound potatoes, 8 Ibs. can be procured from such as have become so far decayed as to be useless as an article of food."
"10. To obtain the flour separate from the decaying celis, the potatoes should be first very thoroughly washed, so that not a particle of dirt remains upon them; they should then be finely grated with a bread grater into a tub of water, and the pulp well stirred about to separate the particles of starch as much as possible from their cells. |The whole should then be left to settle, and the heavier particles of starch will soon fall to the bottom, whilst the lighter skin and cells will settle above them, and may be poured off with the water. The mass of flour formed by the settling of the particles should be washed two or three times more, by pouring water upon it and stirring it about, and again leaving it to settle as before. After the flour is considered to be sufficiently washed, it must be spread upon a cloth, placed on a board in the sun, or in a warm room, to dry; or it may be dried in the oven after the bread has been removed. It may then be kept for any length of time, and when wanted, used like wheat flour for making puddings, &c. This process will be sufficient for common purposes, but a more perfect method may be described, by which the potato flour can be procured in its purest state, in which it is frequently sold for arrow-root, and by a variety of other names as a delicate food for weak digestions, for children, and for the sick."
"11. The more perfect process for obtaining the flour in the form of “British Arrow-root"" is as follows:—a. Thoroughly wash the potatoes; b. Peel away the skin, without cutting off much; c. Grate the peeled potatoes finely into a pulp; d. Place the pulp on a hair sieve, pour water over it, stirring it about well, till the water ceases to pass through with a milky appearance, e. The pulp left on the sieve may be thrown away, and the milky water put aside to settle; f, When the particles of starch have all settled, the water should be poured off, and fresh water added; the whole stirred up afresh, and allowed to settle again; g. These washings may be repeated four or five times, when the starch will have assumed the character of arrow-root, and will have become white as snow, whilst the water will now be perfectly clear; h. The prepared flour must be thoroughly dried,"
O  and may be kept for any length of time in jars or casks.
"12. When a dish of potatoes is about to be obtained from the inside parts of such as are only partially decayed, instead of peeling them, the decayed parts may be grated, and whatever starch can be extracted from these parts might be added to the boiled potatoes. Thus very little will he lost of the whole amount of nourishment which the potatoes would have contained if they had been quite sound. In many cases it may be more convenient to keep such gratings for three or four days, till enough has been collected to make it better worth while to complete the process."
"- 13. In times of scarcity it may be useful for persons to be made aware of the fact, that excellent starch-like arrow-root may be procured from certain wild plants. In- the Isle of Portland, some of the poor are in the habit of preparing it from the tubers of the plant commoiily called “Lords and Ladies"" (Arum macalatum). The tubers are well washed and grated, and the pulp treated like that of the potato. The process gets rid of acrid Juice with which the fresh tuber abounds. This sort of arrow-root is sold in the neighbourhood of Weymowlh for about 8d. the pound. ; ;"
"14. It was suggested that local companies or societies might be formed, to buy up the decaying potatoes, and to employ some of the poor to prepare the starch, which could be sold at little or no loss. It is he practice in Scotland, when the store potatoes are found to be frozen to extract the starch from them in the manner described."
This advice seems to have formed the basis for later advice emanating from some of the learned societies in Ireland.
"FAILURE IN THE POTATO CROP Farmers Gazette, October 4th 1845, pages 361-362"
"Sir—lf you remember when, on a late occasion, I had the pleasure of meeting you in the railway-train, and speaking of the rot or failure of the potato crop in other places, you expressed yourself somewhat thus— ""I have been lately through the south-western part of Dublin, and part of the county of Kildare, and I heard few, if any, complaints of the rot in potatoes; and as far as external appearances go, the crops look exceedingly well."""
"1 have since travelled the same line, and considerably farther than you went; and as far as external appearances would lead me to form an opinion, I could then say the crops looked better at that season of the year; but, circumstances have since led me to examine the crops more, minutely, and, alas I fear both you and I and many others; have been sadly mistaken ; ‘first, as to the absence of rot; and secondly, as to the produce compared to what, we should expect from the then “external appearance*"" of the crop."
"As the subject is of paramount importance—affecting, as it does, the condition of all"
"classes, in this country at least, but more especially the farmers, labourers, and what is termed ""the poor""--] hope you won't consider it too great a trespass on"
"64  your widely-circulated pages, as, indeed, it is a trespass on my time, to offer a few hasty remarks on the two subjects embodied in my introductory announcements: first, as regards the produce that may be expected, compared to the "" external appearance"" of the crops ; and, secondly, as regards the ' disease which, I fear, at present affects, and hereafter will more seriously affect that produce. ;"
"- I have reason to know, that during the memory of the oldest amongst us, a greater breadth of land has never been planted under potatoes, in Ireland at least; and I have still better reason to know, that, unfortunately, the produce of marketable potatoes will not be more than from one-half to three-fourths of what should be expected from crops of such ""external appearances."" The quantity of middle-sized potatoes, such as in ordinary seasons would answer well for seed, appears considerable, whilst the quantity of refuse appears large indeed. There appears this season, to a much greater extent than I have ever before witnessed, that complication of diseases always visible to every observer of ordinary accuteness; and in addition to that, is Ihe new disease, of which we are all still so ignorant, except of its existence. If the diseases were confined to the ordinary classes, we would find little difficulty in arresting their progress. Out of the many successful and unsuccessful remedies applied, there is a simple one which I have found, from considerable experience, to be quite efficacious, and within every man's reach, being nothing more than the mixture of equal quantities of newly- slaked lime and dry earth, turf-mould, or ashes, strewed amongst the potatoes when housed or pitted. This has been already noticed, some two years ago, by Mr. Walsh, steward to Mr. Cotleman, Flesk-Castle, Killarney, between whom and Lord Kenmare's gardener, Mr. Boylan, the discovery was made. By their example I have practised it for several years, to which I attrioute my having prevented rot of every kind in the crop when stored, and subsequently planted. But here you may permit me to add, theory steps in, and, by its ""light,"" throws a shadow of doubt on the practice, which is, by the way, a sort of Irishism. However, you have ""Paddy's"" practice, and I shall beg of you to hear ""John Bull's"" theory. I find in the Bristol Mercury of Saturday, the 20th uit, a correspondence between Lord Portman, president of the Royal English Agricultural Society, and Mr. Herapath, an eminent chemist in Bristol. I shall not trouble you with more than a few extracts that bear on this subject. His lordship says, ""I have directed some potatoes to be stored in slaked lime, in the hope that it may preserve them, but have, of course, yet, had no time to judge of the effect. |, therefore, ask your opinion, as one of our most eminent chemists, upon tins point, and would ask leave to make known your reply, if you are able to offer an opinion suficiently explicit to be useful."" To thin the learned chemist replies:—""As far as the slaked lime which you have used in your potato stores has a tendency-to prevent the tubers from touching each other, or by its power of absorbing water"
"of keeping them dry, it will answer a good end; but it is not to be expected to have any chemical effect upon the diseased parts or their juices; anything which, like dry sawdust or sand, would prevent contact, would propagation from one tuber to another; and any substance capable of absorbing the moisture of the air in which the potato is stored, would prevent the extension of the disease from the extension of the disease in each affected root."""
"Now it would badly become me, nay, I should be one of the last to insinuate"
"O  anything having a tendency to cast reflection on the opinions of a man of undoubted scientific knowledge. But this much I can say, that as far as the former rot in potatoes was concerned, I have tried dry, nay, baked sawdust, earth, sand, turf-mould, and dry ashes, and none of them had the effect alone in arresting that disease, whilst the dry lime, used alone, and in combination with all the other substances, the sawdust excepted, has had the desired effect; but as the present rot is yet so little known to us, and as Mr. Herapath appears to have given it much attention, his opinions are, in my mind, highly deserving of much practical consideration, and will, therefore, give another short extract from his letter—""Our best microscopists and cryptogamists are divided, in opinion, as to whether the cause of the calamity is a fungus or not. After all the examination I have given to the subject, and a careful review of all the evidence brought before me on the two sides, I believe that it is."" He then recommends the converting the tubers as far as practicable into starch, and gives the process which, as you have already described, I shall not introduce here; still the subject is well worthy of attention; and to those who would be disposed to try the experiment, I would recommend the taking up of Mr. Pooler's little Manual, where they will find excellent instructions how to proceed. As there is still a diversity of opinion amongst scientific men, regarding the ""cause being a fungus;"" if my observation be not impertinent, in juxta position with that of Mr. Herapath, I would say, it is not."
"Public attention has, I believe, been first arrested by the decaying appearance of the stalk, or stem, when, ultimately the tubers were found affected. I have reason to fear that many of the tubers were affected long before any visible change took place in the stalks: of this I shall endeavour to give you a practical illustration. All the potato crops, in this locality, possessed their usual verdure, till their growth was checked by the frosts of last week and the week before, still the tubers are affected, but in a manner not visible to the naked eye of any ordinary observer."
"I have examined the crops in several places, and I found the tubers, although very small, comparatively speaking, apparently sound; so much so, that the owners could not be persuaded that there was the least danger of the disease. An idea struck me, the theory of which I am not fully able, in the present instance, to explain; but which is, I respectfully conceive, worthy of the attention of those who can spare more time, and bring more scientific information to bear on it. It is this. I got three small stones of -well-burnt but unslaked lime, placed them on a level part of the potato-land, wet them sufficiently to cause slaking, placed over them (but not in contact with them) a common corn riddle, with its bottom upwards, on which I placed several po- tatoes that I suspected, and several others that I scarcely suspected, and others that could scarcely, if at all, be suspected; on all I placed a washing tub, without handles (that would prevent its lying closely), and then closed the earth round the mouth of it to prevent the access, as far as was practicable, of the external atmosphere; left them so for 24 hours; and, on examining them, I found the suspected tubers in a forward state of decomposition; those that I had barely suspected, much affected; and some that I had little room to suspect, showing blotches, which plainly indicated to me that they were previously affected, although showing no signs of decay in the tuber, or no"
"66  unusual sign at the stalk or stem. From these, and a few other circumstances"
"that I shall briefly touch on, I think I am warranted in the fear I now entertain, that the disease has made a greater progress in the potato crops through the country, than most people suspect, on account of the healthy appearance the growing crops presented up to the period of the late frosts. I have reason to think, appearances of disease, of an unusual kind, will be found in many of the tubers on close inspection. I shall now instance two well-known varieties, and endenvour to describe the appearance of the disease as it strikes me. They are the common cup, or “minion"" as it is called in some places, and the common lumper or ""horse-potato,"" as some cail them. In the first there will be ‘found some deep red spots, sometimes near the root end, sometimes near the crown or rose end, and not unfrequently through the greater part of the potato. Tihis is, I think, an early indication of the disease in those parts, which, on further decomposition, will assume a purplish cast, and finally become black. In the lumper, whose colour is different, the first indication is the appearance, on its white skin, of blotches of a cream colour, subsequently yellow and brown, and finally black. There is no time at which these can be so easily detected as when the tubers are just taken up in dry weather; for, an exposure to the light, and the influence of the atmosphere, these marks, in either variety, will be less perceptible. If my opinions be correct, is it too much to request that every man, woman, and child, employed in raising and securing the crop, will have a sharp look out to discover the appearance of disease, and separate the good from the bad, or even suspected. I know not now, after the opinion given by Dr. Herapath, on the subject of lime, as applicable to the storing of potatoes, whether warranted, in recommending it generally for the prevention of the new disease; I will merely say, I am trying it, and if found successful—if an opportunity presents itself—will report the result. I anticipate an objection that may be raised by some good-natured or fastidious friend, which is this—that if in one case I find lime to hasten decomposition, how could I, in the other, recommend the use of it to prevent it ? To this I would reply, in limine: bear in mind, that the lime, effects the of which were decomposition, was caustic,"" "" quick,"" or ""roach lime;"" whilst that which I have found to arrest it was, ""mild"" or ""slaked"" lime, reduced previously to a fine powder. However, the facts have been as I have endeavoured to state them; and if they be of any value, the public are entitled and welcome to them."
"The introduction of this subject carries its own apology—not so the length to which it has run. If, as I feel I have, trespassed unnecessarily on your attention, or outraged your patience, my apology is, ""it is the first offence,"" and hope it will be forgiven; and as a sure proof of my amendment, I shall not trouble you again."

O  THE POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, October 4"", 1845, pages 363-364 (From the Bristol Mercury, September, 22.)"
"The following correspondence has just taken place between Lord Portman, president of the Royal Agricultural Society, and William Herapath, Esq., the eminent analytical chemist of this city, in reference to seed potatoes for 1846."
"SIR- I observe, in the newspapers, that you have directed your attention to the potato disease, and have advised as to the use of the starch, &c. As I am specially bound, during this year, of my holding the office of president of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, to promote inquiry, and to notify observation on the subjects relative to the produce of the soil, I trouble you with this letter, and ask if any method has occurred to you by which the potato may be preserved for the planting of 1846 ? I have found that potatoes, apparently sound and free from disease, though in a field or garden which has been particularly diseased, have, after being stored away, signs of the disease, and rotted off; and I fear that the greatest quantity of the potatoes will thus perish, and so continue the distress of the ’ poor into another season. I have directed some potatoes to be stored in slaked lime, in the hope that it may preserve them; but have, of course, yet had no time to judge of the effect. |, therefore, ask your opinion, as one of our most eminent chemists, upon this point, and would ask leave to make known your reply, if you are able to offer an opinion sufficiently explicit to be useful."
"! remain your obedient servant, Wm. Herapath, Esq. Bryanston, Sept. 13, 1845."
"TO LORD PORTMAN, PRESIDENT OF THE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY"
"My Lord—tn reply to your letter of the 13th inst., I must say that I do not think it would be either safe or prudent to depend upon the infected potatoes of the present season as seed for the next year; as, in all instances, I have found the diseased parts to extend when the potatoes are kept in a damp situation, I should therefore expect that if any diseased seed was kept so dry as not to rot before setting time, yet, upon being planted and left in the damp soil, the rotting process would then begin, and the hopes of the husbandman be disappointed. I have no doubt that some potatoes, apparently sound, have (as stated by your Lordship) been found to be effected after stowing away : but I do not consider this to have been an orgination of it, but merely that that which was not noticed when dug, has become apparent after storing. When a potato is first affected the diseased parts are scarcely visible; but upon keeping it in a dry place the spots soon become dark and consequently more apparent, but the spots do not extend ; if, however, the tuber has been kept in a damp place, the spots not only extend rapidly over the surface, but penetrate into the interior, and in a short time it will be completely rotten. As far as the slaked lime,"
"68  which you have used in your potato stores, has a tendency to prevent the tubers from touching eaeh other, or, by its power of absorbing water, of keeping them dry, it will answer a good end; but it must not be expected to have any chemical effect upon the diseased parts or their juices. Anything which, like dry sawdust or sand, would prevent contact, would prevent the propagation from one tuber to another; and any substance capable of absorbing the moisture of the air in which the potato is stored, would prevent the extension of the disease in each affected root. Our best microscopists and cryptogamists are divided in opinion as to whether the cause of the calamity is a fungus or not. After all the examination I have given to the subject, and a careful review of all the evidence brought before me on the two sides, I believe that it is: and I am daily confirmed in the opinion originally expressed, that the only advantageous way of treating the diseased potatoes is, to obtain from them, by rasping end washing, the starch that they contain— by which process all their nutriment can be retained; and if it be well dried, it will keep for any length of time. The operations can be performed in the cottage or manufactory alike, as no apparatus beyond a tin rasp (a nutmeg grater), a tub, and clean water, are required; and I have ascertained, that however far the disease might have extended, even if the root be rotten, yet the starch can be separated, and ina state fit to be eaten, if it shall be well washed, as all the bad parts come away with the water, while the great weight of the starch carries it to the bottom of the vessel. If it be required that the fecula should have all the qualities of the best foreign arrow-root, it is only necessary to wash it last in water containing a little chlorine, when it has unrivalled colour and quality; and this I can speak of practically, having made many tons of the article. I will only add, that an opinion has been circulated, that the disease is owing to the introduction of guano as a manure; this I feel no hesitation in contradicting, as I have seen it in situations. where no guano has been used, and in those where every other variety of manure has been resorted to."
"1am your Lordship's most obedient servant, WILLIAM HERAPATH. Bristol, Sept. 17, 1845."
FAILURE IN THE POTATO
"Farmers Gazette, October 11, 1845, page 386"
"SIR—I beg leave to state for your information, which may be interesting to some ,"
"of your readers, that until yesterday I thought my potato crop safe from the prevalent disease; but, on my man closely examining them, and bringing some of them to me, I regret to say, that many of them are seriously affected; and, on inquiry yesterday at the market of Drogheda, the complaints of the disease are but too well founded. One man, who is a very intelligent and clever person (steward to Mr. Charles Rothwell, of Staffordstown, in this county—Meath), told me, that three days ago the potatoes in an adjacent farm, to the extent of nearly fifty acres, were quite safe; and on examination of them, on Friday, the entire breadth is unfit for use. On this you may rely—"

"SIR—As the period is now coming round when the extent of injury sustained by the potato crop will become known, I write to inform you what has been the result of my own observation in a tour which I have just taken through several miles of country between Youghal and Waterford along the sea-coast—a district in which the farmers were congratulating themselves that they had escaped this dreadful affliction; for up to the present month, no appearance of disease had exhibited itself, and the farmer was calculating upon a most plentiful crop. However, within the last few days such hopes have been sadly disappointed: in every field I visited I found the potatoes spotted; and it is apprehended that when put into pits or housed, the injury will extend through all those which now appear sound, and that dearth or famine must be the almost inevitable consequence at the termination of the season. Some persons are disposed to defer digging out the crop until such potatoes as are infected may decay away; while others are laying them in small pits, containing not more than a barrel or two, which they purpose examining from time to time, and removing such as are unfit for use; but the great majority are wholly at a loss to know what to do at such a crisis. If any means have been devised which are calculated to preserve this valuable esculent, you would bestow the most incalculable benefit upon the community by laying it before the public in your esteemed columns; and such information will be most thankfully received by."

POTATO FAILURE
"Farmers Gazette, October 11"", 1845, page 386"
"SIR—I regret to have to inform you, that there is a very great failure of the potato crop in this neighbourhood, and I fear that it is far more general than was at first anticipated. The prospects for the ensuing winter and summer, are indeed alarming; and I fear very much, that unless some great effort is made to meet, as far as possible, this (I must call it) national calamity, the consequence will be frightful indeed."
"Yours, &c., T. H., October 9, 1845"
"70  DISEASE IN THE POTATO Farmers Gazette, October 11, 1845, pages 386-387"
"siR - As the epidemic disease of the potato crop has unfortunately appeared general in this neighbourhocd, I think a few remark; in connection with the subject, require but little apology. There are many theories respecting the cause; but the one which attributes it to the unusual cold and wet of the season, is the most popular. Guano has had nothing to do in, causing it for there are many failures where there never was even a smell of it used. The disease seems not to regard any peculiar soil or climate, either at home or abroad."
"In this neighbourhood we have indications of its commencement in the driest land, and warmest aspect, to as great an extent, as in cold, wet, and retentive clays, less favourably circumstanced as_ to aspect. Several means have been suggested, with the hope of averting or mitigating the evil effects of an attack: cutting off the tops, and slightly harrowing the surface, so as to admit air and, increase evaporation, spreading lime on the surface, &c;., &c., have been tried. In storing them, it is strongly recommended to mix dry bog-mould, lime, ashes, and such other dry absorbent matters with them, as means for lessening the tendency to putrefaction."
"The rot has appeared in all the kinds in common cultivation in this district; but most so, at present, in the earlier and more delicate sorts. My particular desire in noticing this subject is, to direct attention to the consideration, whether or not, such an article of food should be used by either man or beast. I have observed a peculiarly unpleasant flavour in the apparently sound parts, when boiled, and a decidedly fetid smell from the unsound parts. It is impossible that a mixture of such matter can be salutary as food. It is the united testimony of all medical authors, that the use of tainted, decaying food, whether animal or vegetable, gives rise, in the constitution of man, to a great susceptibility to be attacked with all the kinds of pestilential diseases which are common to the locality or climate. Typhus fever is the scourge we suffer most from, and is (with perhaps dysentery) what would be most likely to follow among the poor from the continued consumption of food, such as the potato in its semi rotten condition. I can have no selfish motive in discouraging the sale or use of such an article, as I have several acres growing, which, of course, are as liable to become diseased, as those of my neighbours. However, ""it is a hard battle where all are slain; and we must live in hope.” :"
"It is well known that starch is the principal nutritious ingredient in the potato; and it has been ascertained by scientific men, that it may be obtained pure from diseased potatoes. So this is the only conclusion arrived at by all who have studied the subject, to convert into starch the decaying tubers; and I would beg to add my humble opinion, that it is the only proper, legitimate, and economical alternative at our disposal. I think ail our poor population know how to prepare starch from potatoes. The ordinary machinery employed is not expensive. Let them begin and keep all their spare hands busy. They will thus obtain for themselves a cheap, wholesome, and nutritious article of food; which, when boiled, with the addition of some oatmeal, and used as"
"O  porridge with milk, will form a generous meal of no mean value. Besides, it will economise the potato crop, and have the effect of keeping low the price of such portions of it as may remain sound."
"Starch is a most excellent food for calves. Partners should prepare it from their decaying potatoes for this purpose; or if made clean and pure, a ready market would be easily found at a remunerating price. I shall not further trespass on your space."

"The Council met on Thursday, October 16, 1845—Professor Kane in the chair. The following members, were also present: .John Ross Mahon, William Sherrard, John Sharman Crawford, Hugh Billon Massy, and T. Butler, Esqrs. Mr. Bullen, secretary, stated that he shall remained at Ballinasloe after the show, to pay off the premiums which were awarded on that occasion, to all those who should apply for them. He had received orders for £700 for the purpose, including the grant of £500 from the totality; and he was now prepared to pay off the remainder,-as the different parties should apply to him for them. He also stated, that the accounts at Ballinasloe had been closed in the most satisfactory manner; and though the attendance was not so numerous as was expected, yet that a considerable, balance would be left to the credit of the local committee, after paying all the expenses of the show."
"The secretary also stated that he had received upwards of forty answers from the secretaries of local farming societies, in reply to a circular letter which he had addressed to them by order of the council, to procure information respecting the failure of the potato crop, in their different localities. These reports contained much useful and most accurate Information on the subject, and would form, when compiled and digested, the best statistical data as yet procured upon this all- absorbing question."
"It appeared by the reports, as far as they had gone, that the disease was not known or visible in many of the localities, up to the time of calling for the returns, and the local secretaries had reported accordingly. But in many cases he had received supplemental reports, stating, that on digging the crops, they had found the disease existing in many places where it had not previously appeared; and that, in fact, it was almost impossible to ascertain the true extent of the mischief, until the removal of the crop had proceeded farther."
"The council were of opinion, that they should proceed most cautiously in this business, and for this purpose a sub-committee was formed, to sit from day to day, at one o'clock, to examine the returns, and to prepare such suggestions for a special meeting of the council, to be summoned for Saturday next, the 18th instant, at two o'clock, as they may deem advisable. It was evident; that the evil"
"72  had reached almost alarming heights, and as they possessed machinery through the local societies, admirably calculated for investigating its details, and procuring the best and most accurate information on the subject, it was the duty of the council to spare no effort in laying their deliberate and well-matured views before the public as soon as possible."
"The council then adjurned until Saturday next, at two o'clock."
POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, October 18'"", 1845, page 398-399"
siR — It would be an insult to your judgment were I to offer an apology for again trespassing on your valuable pages with a few hasty remarks on the fatal potato
"- malady; but I beg to apologise to many of the gentlemen who have honoured me with communications on this head since the publication of my first letter, for giving my answers thus hastily and generally, not having spare time to reply to each severally."
"Since I first paid attention, practically, to this scourge, for such it appears to be, I have tried various experiments, not only in the hope of arresting the disease, but also of hastening it — I had almost said of producing it — . and the result I shall "" briefly state, firstly, that any person who may wish the disease to work its own uninterrupted course, will leave his crop on the ground that it grew, on: secondly, without going to the trouble of raising it, or digging out the crop, if he covers up either his lazy beds or drills, he can, for his pains, hasten the malady: thirdly, if in raising his crop, he permits the tubers to be cut, bruised, or otherwise externally injured, he will be gratified by having the malady where he may not have before chanced to observe it. So far for the means of perpetuating the evil, and now for the remedy - a repetition, it is true, of that which |, for the present disease, before recommended, and had practiced for the prevention of farmer diseases, but of which I feel quite satisfied of being the most simple, and yet the most successful of any I have tried—and they were numerous— for the prevention of this new one:— First, let the crop be dug out immediately, and, if possible, without cutting, bruising, or otherwise injuring the surface of the potato, to speak in language intelligible to all: let them be carefully housed, in a dry airy place, and newly-slaked lime sifted over and carefully mixed with the potatoes, so as to come in immediate contact with every part of the skin; and pie heap, when completed, carefully dusted over with the dry, I may say, hof lime—for no one need fear its "" burning” them, if once reduced to a powder, no matter how hot it then can be. This I have, from actual and careful experiment, reason to know, will arrest, first, fermentation; second, decomposition; and I have reason to think, (for my experiment in this respect is still incomplete, ’) finally, putrefaction; and so far from the lime producing any injurious effect on the tuber, for culinary purposes, it will improve the diseased potatoes of every variety—nay, render mild and palatable many of the coarser kinds, having naturally, to use a common phrase, a strong, or wild taste; neither need any one fear that the vegetative powers of the tuber will - be impaired in the slightest degree. This I have known from many years experience, and oft-repeated experiments, but let no one imagine that the mere"
"O  dusting over the surface of the heap, whether in the house or in the pit, will be productive of the desired effect. I feel it necessary to offer this remark, from having seen it lately so done by persons who may have been coerced by their employers to use the lime; but who, either through stupidity, ignorance, or, what may be still worse, prejudice, had the work done in a slovenly and careless manner, regardiess of the injurious consequences to their employers, and the community at large."
"I feel I am incurring a serious responsibility in offering these humble remarks in so unqualified a manner; but being so confident of success, I have little fear of the consequences. Having so far obtained your indulgence, I may have to trouble you again on the subject."
"Yours, &c., E. CARROLL,. 3, Oriel Street, Dublin, 15th Oct. 1843."
"[We would beg to draw the attention of our readers to Mr. Carroll's mode of preserving potatoes, as being the most likely to accomplish this important purpose. His statements being the result of experiment, are better entitled to the confidence of the public, than any mere, general theorizing on the subject.]"
"POTATO AND TURNIP EPIDEMIC Farmers Gazette, October 18°, 1845, page 398-399"
"WE continue to receive the most distressing accounts of the potato epidemic, from all quarters of the country. Scarcely a field seems to have escaped; and several farmers who had flattered themselves, from frequent examination of their fields, that all was right, have been astonished at finding the work of destruction begun, and considerably advanced in the course of twenty-four hours after an inspection, from which they had come to the conclusion, that no disease existed in their crop. To add to the terrible disaster which seems to threaten a winter of severe suffering and famine amongst the poorer classes in this country, a similar disease has broken out in the turnip crop. A gentleman from the neighbourhood of Dundalk, called at our office the other day, with a box of Swedish turnips, giving unmistakable evidence, from the odour they exhaled, that they were in an active stage of decomposition."
"The disease in the turnip, unlike that of the potato, has made its appearance in the core. The whole of the internal structure of the bulb seems to be discoloured and disorganised, while the tops and outer part are perfectly healthy. Nothing can be discovered from an external examination, and it is only when cut up that .the mischief can be perceived. The gentleman above alluded to, came up specially to Dublin in order to get information regarding this dreadful scourge, which, at present, threatens to sweep our green crops completely away. He says that within a circle of five miles around Dundalk, every turnip field is in a state of disease: and further states it as his opinion, founded upon a careful examination of the turnips growing in these fields, that two-thirds of them are gone. They have been grown on different kinds of manure, farm-yard, guano, bones, and guano and ashes; ail are diseased without exception; those grown on farm-yard and. manure most so, and"
"74  those on guano and ashes mixed, are least affected."
"Guano manure has, therefore, nothing to do with the disease; and the cause, whatever it may be, must be looked for elsewhere. So far as we could judge from an inspection by the naked eye of the diseased turnips sent to our office, we have been led to a suspicion, that a species of fungus has something to do with the disease. There seems to be a white wooly substance ramifying through the internal portion of the turnips, something resembling the spawn of a fungus, and which is probably preying upon, arid disorganizing the internal structure of the turnips. All statements regarding the cause of the disease must be wholly conjectural as yet, and we only hazard the above in order that it may induce those who have it within their reach to make a minute microscopical examination of diseased turnips."
"ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF IRELAND Farmers Gazette, October 25'"", 1845, page 419-420 SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL. — SATURDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1845."
"Present — Gustavus Lambart, Esq., of Beau Pare, in the chair; John Ross Mahon, John Sharman Crawford, John Bolton Massy, Thomas Butler, Francis Donagh, George Roe, J. B. Bankhead, Sir Percy Nugent, Bart., William Owen, Robert Kane, M.D., Thomas R. Hardy, William Sherrard, Chas. Wm. Hamilton and Thomas Hutton, Esqrs., members of the council — John Temple Reilly, John Sproule, Hugh Ferguson, V.S., and Toler Osborne, Esars., members of the society."
"Professor Kane, chairman of the sub-committee for inquiring into the state of the potato crop, reported that the committee had sat for the last two days, and care- fully examined all the information as yet received upon the subject. They were not prepared to state anything definitely upon so difficult and momentous a question; but they had instituted the following series of experiments, for the purpose of obtaining the most accurate information on the matter, viz. : — : 4st. That the diseased potatoes should be well sprinkled with salt, in layers, for the purpose of preserving them."
"2ndly. Ditto, with lime in a powdered state."
"3rdly. Ditto, with chloride of lime. :"
Athly. That they should be dried by artificial heat.
"5thly. That they should be subjected to a scalding process, by dipping them in boiling water, &e."
"6thly. That an effort should be made to save the meal, by cutting away the tainted parts, and drying and crushing the sound portion of the potato into meal."
"7thly. To cover up a portion closely with loose clay or sand, &c., so as to exclude air and moisture."
"’ 8thly. Ditto, with loose straw in a dry place, to produce a similar effect."
"The sub-committee had undertaken to institute the above series of experiments at the Dublin Society, under the immediate directions of Professor Kane and Mr."
Hutton; and other gentlemen had undertaken to supply them with a sufficient
"O  quantity of the diseased potatoes for the purpose of the investigation, to which place they are to be sent."
"It was also agreed that similar experiments should be instituted in different parts of the country, and that the results should be communicated to the Secretary as soon as ascertained. . :"
"The committee also reported, that, on mature consideration of the evidence now before them, it was advisable that the council should direct the attention of the Irish government to the now undoubted fact, that a great portion of the potato crop in this country is seriously affected by the disease in question."
"The secretary read the following letter from George Alexander Hamilton, M.P. :—"
MY DEAR SIR — I am sorry it will not be in my power to attend the special meeting of the council this day.
"If, as I apprehend, the accounts from the different parts of Ireland concur in representing the failure in the potato crop as at all general, I think it would be advisable that the council should take means for bringing the subject before the Lord Lieutenant, in the hope that government might take some steps to make provision against the imminent famine. I am aware that, some time since, inquiries were made, through the constabulary, by government; but the character of the disease is so peculiar, and the mode of its operation so unexpected, that the apparent state of the crop of potatoes a fortnight ago affords very incorrect information as to its real state at the present moment."
"Probably the council could not do better than to instruct you to prepare a digest of the information which may have come in from the local societies, such as could be presented to government; and if they were to meet again next week, say on Thursday next, they might then enter into communication with the government on the subject."
"I name Thursday, for I think during the next few days, when the people are beginning to dig their crops, much accurate information will reach you; and it is most desirable that, when we communicate with government, the fullest and most accurate information should be afforded to them."
"Faithfully yours, Geo. A. HAMILTON, Hampton-hall, October 18, 1845."
"Mr. Bullen said that, in anticipation of Mr. Hamilton's suggestion, he had carefully prepared a digest of the communications already received upon the subject, and which he then laid upon the table. It appeared that returns had been received from about forty local Societies, in most of which the disease existed more or less; for though it was stated in some which he had received at an early period that there was no appearance of the malady at that time in the district, yet in many eases he had received supplemental returns, stating that since they had begun to dig the crops the disease had appeared, and at present there was hardly a county in Ireland which could be considered free from it. The returns also contained much useful and valuable information as to the extent and nature of it, which he had abstracted,"
76  and condensed in the digest then on the table in the manner suggested.
"The council were of opinion that, acting on the suggestion of the local committee, which was also in accordance with the letter of Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Bullen, the secretary, should be directed to transmit a copy of the document in question to Sir Thomas Fremantle at the castle, for the advice and information of the Irish go- vernment on the subject."
"And it also appearing that many important changes had taken place since the last circular was issued and as it was most desirable to obtain the best and latest information on the subject, the secretary was directed to prepare a second circular, or form of return, to be sent out at once to the secretaries of the different local societies, calling on them to furnish additional information on the subject, and more particularly as to the actual extent of the damage done in each locality, and whether the removal of the crops from the ground had accelerated their decay or otherwise, or whether any and what means had been successfully adopted for storing and preserving them, and also what particular kinds of potatoes had been most affected, and in what kinds of land, and such other information connected with the subject as they possessed, or would be useful to the council."
"The Secretary was also directed to continue the compilation of the returns as they came in from day to day, in order to furnish the latest and most accurate information to the local committee and the council when they met."
"The Secretary also read a letter from the Messrs. Purdon, proprietors of the FARMER'S GAZETTE, Bachelor's-walk, accompanying some specimens of diseased turnips, which were affected in a similar manner; and also the following letter from the Secretary of the Board of Trade, London, enclosing a copy of a report of a special commission at Groningen, in Holland, appointed to inquire into the disease in that quarter, and which appeared to be exactly similar to that which now affected the potato crops in this country :—"
"Office of Committee of Privy Council for Trade, Whitehall, 20th Sept,, 1845."
"siR—I am directed by the Lords of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade, to transmit to you, for the information of the lrish Agricultural Society, the enclosed translation of a special report of the committee of agriculture of the province of Groningen, relative to the potato disease in Holand. ; oe"
"I have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant, J. MACGREGOR."
REPORT OP THE COMMISSION OF AGRICULTURE OF THE PROVINCE OF GRONINGEN ON THE DISEASE AFFECTING THE POTATO IN THE NETHERLANDS.
"4st. Causes and Nature of the Disease—The agricultural commission is of opinion that the disease is not occasioned by any direct cause, but rather that various circumstances have combined to give the disease this year an extraordinary impulse, it being, in the opinion of many scientific persons not a new scourge."
"O  The primary cause may be attributed to the extremely wet summer of 1844, and to the heavy rains which fell at the moment of the formation of the tubers. It is probably owing to this circumstance that many plants did not germinate. In the second place, the commission is of opinion that the growers do not sufficiently attend to the preservation of the potatoes used as plants, so as to keep them from all damp. It is also very probable that the intense cold in the month of March, much injured the tubers."
The more direct causes are probably as follows:—
"1. The too rapid development of the plants this year. It is well known that those plants which spring up too quickly, and the grain sown on an over-manured soil, are subject to such diseases as ergot for rye and othercereal grains, and rust for wheat, and the presence of cryptogamous plants."
"2. The intense heat in the early part of the summer of 1845, and which amounted on the 13th of June to 87 Fahr., on the 3d July, to 87.5, and on the 7th July, to 91.5, necessarily had the effect of drying up the ground excessively; and the rain which fell at intervals during the continuance of the hot weather, and was soaked in, had the effect of scorching, as it were, those plants and potatoes, which, not being very deeply planted, were exposed to the action of the heated water."
"3. This intense heat was succeeded by cold and rainy weather, which lasted from the 15th July to the end o fthe month of August. This damp weather, and the total absence of the vivifying rays of the sun, caused a kind of rottenness among the pithy plants, and especially developed the cryptogamous plants."
"4. On the 21st and 22nd of July last an extraordinary fog was perceived in many places, which spread a disgusting smell. Soon afterwards, on the 28th of July, the first symptoms of the disease were discovered in the Provinces of Groningen and North Brabant, and it is more than probable that this fog, which was epidemical, was intimately connected with the disease."
"According to all the experiments and descriptions made of the disease, it appears that it commences on the upper part, and then attacks successively the leaf, the stalk, and the tuber. This is fully confirmed by an experiment made at Groningen. As it is the upper part of the stalk which is generally first attacked, it is probable that !the disease originates in the leaves, descends the stalk by means of the peel, and then communicates with the part below the ground."
"5. On the leaves spots have been perceived, and also a kind of fungus described in the work of M. M. Maleschott and Baumhauer, and classed by M. de Martins, among the fusisporium solani. These fungi are similar, in every respect, to those drawn by the above gentlemen."
"It is very probable, then, that the above-enumerated circumstances have been the simultaneous causes of the plant rotting, and of the fungi which are observed thereon. It unfortunately happens that these fungi, which are extremely minute, are quickly propagated to an inconceivable extent, favoured by the dampness of the atmosphere."
"But the principal cause, or rather the character of the disease, is a kind of gangrene or mouldiness in the leaf, which occasions a very hurtful, and even mortal decay to"
"78  the plant. The dangerous influence of the cryptogamous plants has long since been shown by the example of the rust (uredo rubigo) in corn. As soon as the rust spot develops itself on the leaf of the wheat or oat plant, it is observed that the leaf turns yellow, and withers at the spot where the rust shows itself."
"No traces of the fungi have been found in the interior of the stalk or in the tuber. The commission, therefore considers that the disease of these parts results from that of the leaf."
"It is very probable that this disease has very long existed in this country, but it has never hitherto developed itself to attract serious attention; been fed for two years by a moist temperature, it increased this year to a frightful extent, and become a real calamity. The commission is, however, of the opinion that the disease, as now known to us, has never been treated by naturalists. At any rate, it is far from resembling the cancer described by De Martins, or the scurf of potatoes, as these two diseases arise in the tuber and not in the leaves."
"2nd—Remedies for the disease. The disease itself, its character, and causes having been sufficiently considered, it is necessary to consider the remedies for the disease, of which the commission points out three different kinds, viz.:—"
"4st—A means which unfortunately, it is not in our power to adopt at pleasure—that is, a drier atmosphere; for if it be damp that has caused the mouldiness of the leaves, and has propagated it among the plants, it follows that dry weather would put a stop to the ravages of the disease, and even result in entirely destroying it."
"This observation applies to the measures which science may propose, now that the disease has probably reached its period."
"2nd—To prevent the return of the disease, it is necessary to take the following precautions:— 4—To leave the potatoes in the ground until very dry weather occurs. Experiments having shown that their decay is accelerated by being taken up, it is advisable to leave them in the ground at first in order to get dried, and afterwards to lay them _out over the field. This would have the double advantage of rendering the vege- table more wholesome and of preserving it better. 2—The following applies especially to those potatoes to be used as seed for next year. It is necessary to beware of planting those plants which have been attacked by the disease; they must be carefully chosen from those whose stalks have not been attacked, and placed in a situation free from the slighest damp. As the disease has been less severe in gravelly than in clayey soils, the tubers should be chosen from these gravelly soils, where the disease has not penetrated. 3. The withered leaves of diseased potatoes, which are of no value, should be immediately burnt; the same should he done with the rotten potatoes, which cannot be of any use. Nothing should remain of them."
"It is necessary to avoid, as much as possible, planting potatoes in the same spots where they have been planted this year; for it is most probable that seeds of the fungi have remained in these places, and there would be great risk of the ensuing crop being similarly attacked. It is also necessary to manure the land with"
"O  lime after the potatoes have been taken up, and then to clear it; and if the land be employed for produce which need not be planted before winter, it is better not to harrow it, and so allow the air and cold to penetrate it. In the spring the lime manure should be renewed as much as possible; and the land may be watered with diluted sulphuric acid (one part of sulphur to one of water)."
"5. Next year the potatoes should be planted m dry land; and damp places should be avoided, even places shaded by houses or trees. It is once more repeated that great care should be used in selecting the tubers, and they should be planted at a little distance from each other, Bo that the earth round each plant may be raised, that the air may penetrate everywhere,"
"6. The commission does not agree with naturalists who think that the origin of the disease may be attributed to the race of potatoes having gradually deteriorated, owing to their being seldom reproduced in fresh soil. The report mentions that in the commune of Marum (province of Groningen), among other instances, is to be seen a field of potatoes, the produce of only three years’ culture, equally attacked by the disease; and an infinite, number of similar eases prove incontestably that the potato has not degenerated. However, the commission recommends that fresh seeds should be employed this year: for it will then, at any rate be certain that it has not been attacked by this scourge."
"3rd. If, not withstanding every effort, the disease should again break out next year, the moment the first symptoms of it are perceived, the first leaves that turn yellow should be taken off and burnt, or the entire field should be watered towards evening with lime water, or, still better, with diluted sulphuric acid, so as to destroy the seeds of the cryptogamous fungi; sulphuric acid, moreover, prevents rotting, and when prepared as above directed, can do no injury to the plants themselves."
"3.— Use to be made ofthe diseased potatoes. — These potatoes which have been attacked by the disease appear not to be prejudicial to health when taken in moderate quantities. This commission has consulted veterinary surgeons, as to whether the potatoes can be employed without danger to feed cattle. Their reply was in the affirmative; it has been proved moreover, that pigs have eaten the diseased potatoes without death ensuing. The commission are however are of the opinion that they should be cooked beforehand."
"Man may likewise, make use of the diseased potatoes; but most carefully remove the brown spots which caused the disease. It has also been shown by experiment that potatoes which have remained untainted on the same plant, where there are spoiled tubers, maybe eaten without hesitation. It is almost useless to remark that potatoes which are completely rotten, are hurtful not only to man, but also to cattle; and that a too frequent use of spoiled potatoes is equally dangerous to those who make their sole food of them. Dr. Westerhoff remarked that in the commune of Warffum (province of Groningen), those persons who made use of spoiled potatoes,"
"experienced pains in the stomach, and nausea, followed by vomiting after eating them."
"It has also been perceived that sheep have been made severely ill, by eating attacked potatoes, though they were soon cured by a change of food."
"As to the means to be employed to prevent the baneful influence that may be exerted on the health of man by eating the diseased potatoes, the commissioners"
"80  propose to make this the subject of another inquiry. In the meantime, it advises that as much use as possible should be made of the fecula of potatoes."
"ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF IRELAND WEEKLY MEETING OF THE COUNCIL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1845."
"Farmers Gazette, October 25"", 1845, page 420"
"Sir GEORGE HODSON, Bart., in the chair. There were also present—John Ross Mahon, Charles Beper, Peter Purcell, George Alex. Hamilton, M.P., Charles William Hamilton, John Sharman Crawford, George Moore, Aeheson Lyle, J. B. Bankhead, William Jones Armstrong, Thomas Hutton, and David Charles La Touche, Esars., members of the council; William Toler Osborne, William Thompson, John Sproule, W. V. Simpson, Charles Andrews, and Wm. Rathbourne, Esqrs., members of the"
society.
"The Secretary read the minutes of the proceedings which had been written up since the cattle show at Ballinasloe, and the same appearing perfectly correct, were signed by the chairman."
"A letter was read from Mr. Wm. Reilly, of Bellmount, Mullingar, objecting to the award of the premiums for Devon cows, class C., section 3, to Mr. Minnitt, of Annabeg, near Nenagh, on the ground that his Devon cow was not in calf at the time of the show. Ordered.— that the objection should be received, and the premium withheld until the question was decided."
"A similar letter was read from Mr. William Kelly, of Portrane, objecting to the award of the prize in class V, seeds, grasses, ie., to the Messrs. Scott, of Belfast, on the ground that their collection was not taken from a bona fide field crop of not less than half a rood: but the council had decided, at Ballinasloe, that this condition only applied to roots and vegetables, and not to assorted seeds and grasses grown by the exhibitor, and that the prize was properly awarded accordingly."
"A letter was read from the Earl of Clare, Mount Shannon near Limerick, respecting the best and most convenient time for holding the next great cattle show and agricultural meeting in the city, for the year 1846, and it appearing; to the Council most desirable that these shows should be henceforth held at an earlier period of the year, than took place the last time, the consideration of the question was deferred, with this express understanding, that the meeting should be held as early as possible, and that the day for holding it should be fixed and announced previous to the next general meeting of the society, in November."
"Three letters were read from Gustavus Lambert, Esq. of Bean Parc, detailing the existence of the potato disease in his immediate neighbourhood, and furnishing some valuable details and valuable information on the subject; all which were ordered to be referred to the local committee for consideration."
"Letters were also read from Mr. Richard Pennefather, under-secretary at the castle,"
"ie  enclosing communications from Mr. John Dillon Croker, of Mallow, Mr. Anderson, and several others, which they had received upon the subject of the potato disease. Ordered to be duly acknowledged."
"Sir George Hodson being obliged to leave the chair on particular business, Mr. George Alexander Hamilton was called thereto, and the council proceeded."
"Mr. Hamilton stated that he had received various communications on the subject of the potato disease, from different quarters; and, among the rest, from Mr. George Macartney, Lissanore Casile, County Antrim, stating that the disease existed to a great extent in that district, and that the great butk of the crop was already injured most materially. He had considered the subject attentively himself, and he felt called upon to say that he thought the council bound to make every inquiry, and to afford every information and assistance in their power, not only to the public, but to the government of the country also, upon such an important subject."
"Mr. Purcell, honorary secretary to the society, said he regretted that he could not be more constant in his attendance at their meetings. He thought, however, that the council had acted very prudently, in first seeking for the best and most authentic information on the subject, before they had committed themselves with the public. While they possessed the best and most available machinery for procuring information, they should not forget the importance that would be attached to then statements; and for that reason, he thought they had acted wisely in pursuing the course they had done."
"The returns which they had already received from the local societies, though they were not as full and satisfactory as could be desired, yet were conclusive on this one point, namely—that a large portion of the staple food of the country, he would not say one-half the crop, was already destroyed, and that the remainder was in jeopardy. He had written to his own steward, Mr. William Love, who superintended large farms in the counties of Dublin and Kildare, for information, and he had reported to him as follows:—"
"HALVERSTOWN FARM—""About thirty-five statute acres of potatoes—20 per cent, already lost by disease, and 16-36 parts under an average produce."""
"OLDTOWN FARM—""About twenty-two statute acres of potatoes—20 per cent, under an average crop, and 15-35 per cent, already lost by disease."""
"ROYAL GARTER FARM—"" About twenty-two statute acres of potatoes—crop, a fair average one, 20 per cent already lost by disease."""
"OAKFIELD FARM.—""About twenty-four statute acres of potatoes—20 per cent, under an average crop, and 20-40 per cent, already lost by disease."""
"The above is the truth as far as I have been enabled to ascertain up to the present time; and although the loss is deplorably great, yet I fear, that if the report had been deferred for another week, the loss would appear still greater."""
"WILLIAM LOVE, Steward to Peter Purcell, Esq., Halverstown."
"This presented a formidable state of things, in whatever light they viewed it; and he thought the council were bound to act accordingly. The council had also acted"
"82  most properly in preparing and issuing another circular letter, containing the following list of queries, which he hoped would be answered with the greatest care and dispatch, and which could not fail to elicit the most important information on the subject :—"
"1.Has the disease in the potato crop shown itself toany and what extent, in your immediate district"
"2.In what different localities, and to what extent or number of acres have your inquiries been directed ?"
"3. What are its characteristic marks, both in its incipient and advanced stages ? 4.What description of land appears to-have beenmost affected, and what was the previous state of culture of the land thus affected ?"
"5.What kind of potato is most affected, and wasthere any, and what variety in the distinctive featuresof the disease in the different kinds ?"
"6.Does any, and what difference appear in the disease from the periods at which the crops were planted respectively ?"
"7.1s there any marked difference observable, whichcan be distinctly traced to the use of any, and what particular kind of manure or cultivation ?"
"8. Does the period at which the manure was actually; applied to the ground, appear to have produced any, and what effect ?"
"9.Can you estimate the proportion of injury done to the crop, up to the time of your inquiry ?"
"10, What effect has been produced by leaving the crop in the land, and also by the removal of it?"
"41. Have any, and what means been actually resorted for saving the crops after removal from the ground » by storing, drying, converting into meal, starch, &c., ! and. if so, describe the process ? ;"
"42. Detail any further facts that may have come under your own personal information, respecting the disease in Question."
"Mr. Hamilton, the chairman, said, that it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the council, that a statement should be laid forthwith before the government, embodying the above sentiments as the results of the inquiries hitherto made by that council, through the machinery at its command, and then leave it to the prudence and wisdom of her majesty's responsible advisers, on being made fully aware of the facts, to adopt such immediate measures of precaution and remedy as may avert the impending evil, and save the hitherto impoverished inhabitants of this country from those sufferings and privations arising from the failure of their stock of food which now inevitably threaten them. That, in the meantime, Mr. Bullen, their secretary be directed to issue the second circular to the secretaries of the different farming societies, calling on them to procure the best and latest information on the snbject; and that he do communicate the replies from “time to time to his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant."
"And, it appearing to the council that the series of experiments on the diseased potatoes instituted by Professor Kane, not being sufficiently matured as yet, it would be premature to give forth any specific advice or directions at present on the subject, until the results were formally communicated to them; but that the council were agreed as to the propriety of recommending in all cases the immediate separation of the diseased potatoes from the sound ones, and that all"
"O  potatoes grown in low, swampy situations should be dug out and removed forthwith, and placed in a dry situation—it being generally found essential to their preservation that they should be kept as dry as possible ; and, for this purpose, it was generally recommended that a mixture of slacked lime, powdered, should be sprinkled over them, where available, when placed in the different pits or store- houses—that being universally admitted to be the best and safest preservative yet known for applying to the crop, either as a matter of precaution or of cure."
"The secretary also stated, that Professor Kane had attended that day, in company with Professors Playfair and Lindley, who had just arrived from London, by orders of the government, to be associated with him in the series of experiments which he was then making on the subject, under the directions of the society, and that they were ready and willing to receive every advice and assistance on the subject; that they were anxious to conduct the experiments at the Eoyal Dublin Society House, Kildare-street, on a most extensive scale; and for this purpose it was most desirable that the persons interested in their success should supply them with as large a stock of the diseased article as possible, and as many varieties, and from as many different localities as would be convenient."
"It was also agreed that it was most desirable, in the present emergency, that the council should adjourn and sit from day to day, at two o'clock, for the purpose of receiving and procuring the best and latest information on the subject, and that every effort should be made to satisfy the public mind, that everything would be done, which prudence could dictate, to procure the best and most accurate information on the subject, to guide their future proceedings."
"THE POTATO CROP Editorial - Farmers Gazette, October 25'"", 1845, pages 424-425"
"We are this week literally overwhelmed with communications respecting the general prevalence of the potato Pestilence and so precisely similar do they correspond in their details, that the fact of a very extensive and general injury in the crop, is but too well proved. Several of these communications urge upon us the necessity of suggesting some mode of saving, if possible, although it be only a portion of what, in this country, constitutes the principal part of the poor man's diet. Our columns this day teem with various opinions on this subject, and much useful information may be gleaned from the proceedings of the Cork Agricultural Society, several members of which have been carefully investigating it."
"in the following remarks, we shall only allude to those modes of preserving the potato crop for food and for seed, that can be generally adopted and acted upon. Three plans have been suggested for effecting these purposes, all of which, so far as can be predicated, promise to be successful. The first of these is to take up the crop, and to separate the good from the bad during the operation, so far as that is practicable. The good potatoes areI then to be stored in dry pits, and plentifully strewed with newly slaked lime, or with dry earth and lime mixed. The second plan is to take up each alternate drill, and then cover up the remaining drills by throwing the earth over them with the plough, so as to secure them from the winter frosts."
"84  The third mode recommended is to convert the whole of the crop into starch. The object attained in the first of these modes, by using hot lime, is the removal of superabundant moisture from the potatoes, which is accomplished by virtue of the affinity which newly, or partially slaked lime has for water; and as moisture is the predisposing cause in the decomposition of organic structures, more especially when that process has already .commenced, the fair inference is, that its removal will tend, ina great measure, to arrest that process. But lime itself is a decomposing agent, and if mixed in too large quantities, might only hasten what it was intended to stop. Where liming is adopted, the proper plan is to lay up the potatoes in narrow bins on the surface of a piece of dry ground. The bottom of the heap should be plentifully strewed with lime, and each barrel of potatoes, as it is laid down, also sifted over sufficiently thick to envelope each tuber in a thin coating of lime. The moisture on the outside of the potato will combine with the lime, and give it an artificial degree of dryness which, in most cases, will arrest the farther progress of the disease, or at least prevent it from being communicated from one tuber to another. This is a much more simple and effective process than cutting the potatoes into slices, and then drying them artificially. The second mode of preserving potatoes is more particularly applicable to the saving of seed for next year. By allowing potatoes to remain in the ground all winter, the whole extent of the evil will be apparent before the period arrives for planting in spring. Those that are now affected with the - disease will then be completely destroyed, whereas the sound ones will remain uninjured, and will, it is reasonable to suppose, be fit for seed. The third plan recommended, by which it is proposed to convert the potatoes into starch, is the only one that can be of any use in cases where they are in an active state of decomposition, for where every tuber is affected it is doubtful if lime would have the effect of arresting the disease; and it is beyond all doubt evident that potatoes in this state, if left in the ground, would, in a few months, become a mass of putrefaction. tint the great difficulty that presents itself to the making of starch is the want of machinery wherewith to carry out the process, and still further the fact that few farmers know anything at all of how it is to be conducted."
"Professor Kane, in his excellent standard work on he ""Industrial Resources of \reland,” gives the following condensed detail of the process of starch-making, which will greatly assist our readers in understanding it sufficiently well to enable them, at least, to commence preperations, and when once begun, the difficulties which at present appear insurmountable, will soon disappear:--"
"The preperation of starch from the potato is an operation of a very simple kind, and well adapted for the industry of the smaller towns, where potatoes would be usually cheap. It requires only the most ordinary skill, and involves little machinery, the greatest nicety in it being perfect cleanliness, and care that the washings be well finished and with pure water. The operations of the manufacture are,"
1st. Washing the tubers.
2nd. Rasping them to a pulp.
3rd. Pressing the pulp.
4Ji. Waging the rough starch.
"5th. Draining and drying the produce,"
6th. Bolting and storing.
Of these operations it is only necessary to notice one or two in detail. The breaking
"O  up of the tubers into a pulp is accomplished by means of catting cylinders, to which the potatoes are supplied from a hopper, nearly as grain is to a mill. The more rapidly the cutters move the finer is the pulp reduced, and the more perfect the subsequent extraction of the starch; and, hence, they generally make 600 to 900 turns in a minute; and as these cylinders are usually about twenty inches in diameter, their periphery moves with a velocity of from 1000 to 1500 yards in a minute. A single cylinder of the above dimensions and of sixteen inches long, mating 600 revolutions in a minute, will reduce to pnip about fifty bushels of potatoes per hour. This for the twelve working hours is about ten tons."
"The object of pressing or sifting the pulp is to separate the fecula from all foreign substances, especially from the cellular tissue, which, being coarser, rests on the sieve through which the fine starch passes. A great variety of mechanical arrangements have been constructed for this purpose, which fulfill their object; but there remain always with the residual pulp two or three per cent, of the fecula which it is impossible to obtain."
"The starch diffused in the current of water by which it has been washed out from the pulp, is run into vats, where it gradually settles. When the water has become quite Clear, it is poured off, and fresh Water put on: finally the starch is taken out and dried on floors. As it consolidates into very firm masses it requires finally to be broken down by a kind of bolting machine, before being put up for sale."
"""We may add to this clear and intelligible detail of the process, that the potatoes should be washed in a sparred wooden cylinder, half immersed in a trough of water, and turned by a crank handle. By turning the washer, haif filled with potatoes, rapidly, and continuing the operation sufficiently long, occasionally pouring out the discoloured and adding pure water, the whole of-the skin and diseased parts of the potato may be washed off, by which means the purification of the starch will be more easily accomplished. In the rasping part of ;he progress, it is necessary to have the rough perforated cylinder sufficiently near the sides of the frame, or lower part of the hopper, in order to prevent any small pieces of the potatoes from passing through unrasped. In handmills the rasped potatoes are allowed to fall from the under’ part of the cutting cylinder into a tub, or trough of any kind; it is then laid upon a fine wire-gauze sieve, having about 400 meshes to the square inch, and the fine starch granules are washed through the interstices by pouring on water, and agitating the mass with the hand. The ligneous, or fibery portion of the potato, and also the gluten remain on the sieve, and constitute properly speaking, he pulp of the potato. Whena starch machine is compete in all its parts, the rasped potatoes are carried by allowing a thin stream of water to fall upon them nto a semi-cylindrical wire- gauze apparatus, in close contact with which a series of brushes in a spiral form, re made torevolve on aspindle; these brushes clear away the pulp from the interstices of the wire, and allow the starch to pass readily through. This apparatus is placed in an inclined position, so that the pulp, by the revolution of the brushes is made to pass ff at the lower end. When the potatoes have been carefully washed before being rasped, and not rotten inside, the starch subsides perfectly pure; but if any soil has been allowed to adhere to them, the finer portions of it will pass through the sieve along with the starch, and will subside before it, in consequence of its greater density. The lower part of the starch will thus be"
"86  contaminated and discoloured by a small quantity of soil. I Careful washing will,"
"however, obviate this foil. In washing diseased potatoes more care will be necessary, as the ligneous and glutinous portions being in a State of free composition, and consequently in a fine state of subdivision, much of these will be washed through the sieve along with the starch. As this putrid matter is much lighter than starch, it will remain suspended in the water long after the starch has subsided, so that it may be poured off: by washing and decanting until the water becomes colourless, complete purification can be effected."
"The next and most tedious part of the process is drying the starch. It may be accomplished in several ways, according to the circumstances or convenience of individuals. Cm a large scale it may be effected by means of a stove placed in the middle of a close apartment. The moist starch should be broken up as much as possible with the hand, then placed in shallow canvas trays, arranged in a series of layers along the walls of the apartment, and supported on frames made for the purpose. An immense number of these trays may thus be exposed at one time to the heated fair of the apartment; and the process of drying will be very much hastened by rubbing down the small lumps of starch with the hand occasionally, and also by changing trays to a warmer part of the apartment as the starch dries, so as to expel every portion of moisture. Two days will generally suffice to complete the process of drying, and the starch may then be put into dry bags and will, in this condition, keep for many years. The cottager cottager who has no apartment but that in which he lives—and who, although he half, has no means of buying a store, may still, by suspending the moist starch in small bags in the roof of his cabin, succeed ia drying a considerable quantity for the use of his fatally; or he may spread it out to the sun and wind when the weather is dry."
"Potato starch cannot, however, by itedf, be considered proper food for a working man: it contains only the elements which enable him to breathe; and salts. Combined with some other material containing the muscle-forming substance, such food weald be a mere mockery, and would not keep him alive many When mixed with wheaten flour or oatmeal, it will afford an excellent, wholesome, and nutritious bread. The pulp, when steamed or bailed and salted will readily be eaten by pigs; and when mixed chaff, cattle also are very fond of it. When long kept, it sours; yet even in this state it is will relished by pigs, and some feeders consider it more nourishing when stored than when newly boiled."
"In what has been advanced above, our remarks have been confined solely to the explanation of such modes of dealing with the present diseased potato crop, as can"
"- be generally adopted. ""With regard to other plans which have been recommended elsewhere, such as slicing the potatoes and afterwards kiln-drying them, sprinkling with chloride of lime, or even applying salt, they are, we think, all objectionable. The first is tedious, we fear, impracticable, upon a large scale; the second is more scientifically curious than generally useful; and the third, if we reason from the -fact that potatoes which have been accidentally wetted in ships with saltwater rapidly rot, will appear to be altogether inadmissible."
The progress of the potato disease has now reached a point; at which it becomes
"the imperative duty of those to whom the country is entitled to look in cases of emergency, to make preparations for providing food for the labouring classes of"
"Q  this country, whose principal article of diet is every day diminishing in quantity, and deteriorating in quality. Stopping distilleries and opening the ports, are neither of them sufficient to meet the present exigences of the country. Steady employment and good wages, will alone enable our working agricultural population to overcome the difficulties of their present position. Every landlord should, therefore, arouse himself to the task, not of feeding the labourers on his estate gratuitously, but of finding them employment. Let a general and sustained system of draining, be commenced all over the country, so that every one who is able to work may be employed; let them be paid adequately for the work performed, and they will be able to buy food, although high in price, for themselves; while at the same time, the country will be benefited; whereas, if they ba led to depend on the gratuitous aid of others, they will be rendered idle and improvident; and what is worse, degraded in their own estimation."
We intend to recur next week to the important subject of providing employment for the labouring classes during_the coming crisis.
"DISEASE IN THE POTATO CROP Farmers Gazette, October 25"", 1845, page 425"
"SiB—I regret to say that the disease, whatever it is, has come amongst the potato crop in this locality, and, from all I hear, is, I much fear, very general. The farmers and labourers are in a great state of anxiety; and I really can compare their expressions to nothing but the remembrance of what they endured under the infliction of the cholera. Potatoes being their all, their sole subsistence—if they fail, the people look in terror to a famine. For what has already suffered, there is no remedy; and our only hope is to preserve what may be yet uninfected. From what I have read, and principally in your GAZETTE, I would presume to offer my opinion on the best mode of proceeding now; and I would say, pull (not out) all the stalks, spread from thirty to forty barrels of lime per acre on the crop, and dig out. The hot lime will accelerate decomposition in those affected, and make them more easily known. Separate the sound from the unsound, and pit the unsound. To preserve these in their present state for future use and next year's seed, is a great object. It is recommended to put layers of compost of lime and dry earth: I would try this with some; with other pits I would try layers of salt. We know, in other matters, such as meat and hay, it is an antiseptic; and that cabbage is preserved in Germany by placing layers of rock salt between each layer of cut cabbage, which otherwise would decompose and rot in a short time. In other pits I would recommend layers of charcoal: this will, I know, prevent decay. I have sent game, in which bits of charcoal were put, a long distance, and they arrived quite sound. Pieces of charcoal were put into a cellar or bran, which was getting unsound, and it has been brought into a state of perfect sweetness by them. Peat mould is an antiseptic; and bodies of animals have been found in bogs undecomposed. Perhaps by filling the interstices between the potatoes in the pits with peat mould—from the turf heap—future decomposition might be prevented, Agriculturists are now like the physicians, when first (and I may say last) the cholera visited the land, certain of no remedy, but desirous to try every one likely to succeed. Professor Kane's opinion would be of great value; but every remedy"
"88  directed should be reduced to as much simplicity as possible; as the people for whom it is required are, in a great degree, ignorant. °"
"In the hope that some of these preventatives may be of use or lead to others directing bettor, I send them for your consideration; at the same time, recommending that the pits be examined, say months time after pitting, or less and a new separation made of sound and unsound. The subject is one of the greatest moment and I trust the preservation of the potato will occupy the thoughts and the pen of your correspondents lor some time. As yet, I have found no decay in my own crop; and if they escape, I attribute it to their ""being planted whole, and to being abundantly covered with earth with spade and shovel after being earthed with the plough—some of the ground having been trenched two feet deep, and the rest heavily sub-soiled."

THE POTATO EPIDEMIC
"Farmers Gazette, October 25"", 1845, page 425"
"Sir—Having examined several fields of potatoes in this neighbourhood, in company with an intelligent farmer, all of which were slightly affected, we came to the conclusion, that the injury is caused by the constant rot conveyed by the stalk to the root, as we almost invariably found the potato immediately under, or in con- tact with the stalk, more or less affected, and those farther from the stalk, whether deep, or near the surface, sound. Again, in lazy beds, when the stalk had drooped from the edge of the bed into the furrow, the injury was not observable; but in the middle of the beds where the stalk was comparatively upright, the injury was more generally apparent. The earlier crop which had withered before the late frosts, are least affected. When late, and the stalks green, at the time of frost, the injury is greatest. I have placed infected and sound potatoes separately, and together in pits, to see the effects, but so far as we are able to judge, the injury has not increased since we have observed it; and the disease has not entered above a quarter of an inch into the root, generally speaking—"

DISEASE IN THE POTATO
"Farmers Gazette, October 25h, 1845, page 425"
"sir—As the destructive disease, so generally prevalent in the potato, continues daily to gain ground, although apprehensive that the time may have passed for successfully adopting the measures which I am about to suggest, to check its progress; yet, in the hope that it may not be too late, and that the suggestion may"
"O  be useful to some, I send for your publication, if you think fit, a statement of the mode of treatment which I have adopted, with what success still remains to be seen. It is founded, 1st, upon the principle that the disease has been communicated, and is daily communicating itself, frqm the stalk to the tuber, by the connecting fibres; and, 2nd, that the disease is communicable from one tuber to another, by contact; in either of which cases I conceive that the mode of treatment which I am about to suggest, must effectually prevent it from extending itself to any potatoes that were not infected previous to its adoption."
"“MODE OF TREATMENT: Pull the stalks carefully, without breaking them; leaving as few of the fibres as possible in the ground. Dig the 1st and 2nd, and the Sth and 6th drills; throw the potatoes of these drills, as you dig them, (so mixed with earth ae to prevent their touching one another,) into the furrow, between the third and fourth drill; then, “with the earth of the four drills that have been dug, cover the two undug drills, and the potatoes of the others, in the form of a potato- pit, running the whole length of your drills. If the disease be communicated from the stalk to the tuber, I by the fibres (and this may very well be the case al-! though the stalk be dead, for the taint may travel very . slowly down the fibre, ); this mode of treatment, by : cutting off the connection, must prevent the disease from reaching to any not previously infected; if it be communicable by contact, it will be equally effectual; ; nor am I altogether without hope that a temporary ex-i posure to the air, and removal in the ground, may i tend to check the advance of disease, even in those already tainted. The objections to this plan are, 1st, the expense of labour, whilst success is uncertain; and; 2nd, its interfering with the putting in of the wheat crop. As to the first, I can only say, the labour is con- siderable; but, if it affords even a chance of, in any degree, checking the progress of a disease, which at present seems to threaten us with famine, it becomes the duty of those who can afford it, to adopt it."
"As to the second objection, I would suggest that, after the potatoes had remained for a month in the state above mentioned, they should all be uncovered- those that may then be saved separated from the tin; sound, and housed or pitted, as may be thought safest; I should prefer the former; this will clear the ground in time for putting in wheat."
"By manufacturing the unsound portion into starch, (a very simple process, and pretty generally understood,) you will preserve, in a form available for human food, a very nutritious part of the potato, perfectly free from all the deleterious particles."
"Yours, &c., F. S. T., Athy, October 19, 1845."
THE POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, October 25th 1845, page 425"
Sir- I take leave to mention to you what I have found the most satisfactory test of selecting potatoes. I placed all as taken out of the ground in one pit about ten days
"90  since, and this day being fine and bright, I sent three careful, steady men, to pick; on the diseased potato a white spot appeared, more or less, which enabled them to detect the one to be put aside at once; and, certainly, some that would otherwise have passed as sound were detected."
"Having thus carefully picked them, I placed them in a dry house. and shook through them the house-ashes riddled, which, for some time, I have been collecting. I calculated that the present quantity diseased might be one-fifth; but of those, perhaps, not one-fifth are unfit for immediate use, and will yield excellent starch. I think, without the greatest care and attention this month, in selecting the potatoes, the loss will be incalculable, as many will consider their crop safe when it is far from being so. I do not think any potato has become diseased since being pitted; but perhaps many that were not so perceptible ten days since have got worse. :"
"The crop was remarkably fine, and the largest potatoes appear the most injured. I remarked the top and outside of the pit showed most injury. At such a time no person can give any general directions—the most constant, care and attention, I believe, can alone prevent great loss.—"
"Yours, &c., J. A. E., Edgeworthstown, October 23, 1845."
FAILURE IN THE POTATO CROP—OR OUGHT GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE DISTILLERIES
"Farmers Gazette, October 25'"", 1845, page 425"
"siR—I regret to inform you that the outcry and lamentations in this vicinity are awful with regard to the potato rot, which I regret to say is spread all over this district. I have over thirty-six Irish acres wholly destroyed, and I have heard of it all about. I really think that you and all the newspapers in Dublin should direct the attention of government to the frightful consequences to ensue, if some plans are not adopted to secure for our unfortunate country people, whose whole is the potato. The government should I think stop the distilleries, or take some such step, or the consequences may be disastrous, and are awful to contemplate. I write for your information, but of course my name is at your command.—With sincere respect for your exertions in the farmers’ cause."

an Ne
"OQ  Lambert, Esqrs., members of the council; Patrick Corbally, Robert Cassidy, John Sproule, Samuel Winter, and Pierce Mahony, Esqrs., members of the society."
"The secretary read a letter from Wm. Reilly, Esq., withdrawing his objection to Mr. Minnett's Devon cow, to which the second prize had been awarded, at Ballinasloe, and stating that he had received a letter from Mr. Minnett himself on the subject, which was perfectly satisfactory, and the premium was directed to be paid accordingly."
"A report was read, from Thomas Butler, Esq., of a sub-committee which was appointed at Ballinasloe, for the purpose of establishing a society for the promotion and encouragement of chemistry as applied to agriculture, similar to that which now existed in Scotland."
"The Secretary read a number of letters, from various quarters, in reference to the potato disease, and among the rest, from the Earl of Clancarty, chairman of the council, Garbally, expressing his satisfaction that the council were paying so much attention to the subject, but that until the different returns had come in, and the experiments then in progress, by the commissioners, were completed, he thought they could not put forward anything definite on the subject; but he recommended that the council should, at once, call upon each of the local farming societies to meet forthwith, and to communicate the best advice and assistance to the farmers in their immediate neighbourhood, which the emergency of the case would allow ; and enclosing a printed form of address from the Ballinasloe Farming Society to its members, for that purpose."
"A letter was also read from Professor Johnston, of Durham, requesting to be made acquainted with the proceedings of the society on the subject, and suggesting a system of mutual co-operation, which might be of great service in the present emergency."
"Also from Mr. Hudson, secretary to the Royal Agricultural Society of England, stating that it was the intention of their president, Lord Portman, to come to London, in the course of the ensuing month, to hold a meeting of their society for the purpose of investigating the subject."
"A communication was also read from the Lord Lieutenant, enclosing a letter detailing the ""results of some experiments tried with lime waters on diseased potatoes by the Queen's gardener at Windsor. Also from John Dillon Croker, Esq., Mallow, enclosing sonie excellent specimens of bread made partly from potatoes and partly from common flour. Also from William Phibbs, Esc., Seafield, Sligo, enclosing a report from Mr. Cooper of Markree, on the subjects; all which communications, together with various others were referred to the subcommittee for consideration and selection."
"The secretary stated that he had received numerous returns from the local societies in reply to the last circular which he had addressed to them. These returns admitted the existence of the disease more or less in every locality, with exception of part of the counties of Ros-common and Donegal, which"
"92  appeared to be as yet free from it, and he was busily engaged in digesting the evidence as it came in, in order to submit it to the government, ann to the commissioners who were now sitting in Dublin for the purpose of investigating the subjects."
"He had also received a letter from D. J. Wilson, Esq., of Belvoir, in the county of Clare, stating that it was the general opinion in that quarter, that the disease had received a check, and that it was on the decline. This feeling had given rise to the utmost satisfaction all through the district; and the fine weather now prevailing, led them to hope that the remainder of the crop would not be so much injured as was at first anticipated."
"It being the general opinion of the Council, that few things were more wanted in the present emergency, than proper readiness for grinding the potatoes, in order to extract the farina, or potato flour out of them; and it being desirable that an instrument should be procured at as cheap a rate as possible, for the purpose of meeting the wants of the poorer class of farmers, as well as the larger class of proprietors and manufacturers; it was determined to offer two premiums of ten guineas each, for the same: the first premium to be offered for the cheapest and best machine for the purpose, as the one best adapted to the smaller class of farmers ; and the second prize for the best machine generally, without any restriction as to price or class of person. It was also required that these machines, with the prices attached to each, should be deposited with the secretary of the society, in Sackville-street, on or before Thursday next, the 6th of November; and that the successful competitors should be bound to deliver any number of them, as required, at the prices that would be affixed thereto respectively."
"A sub-committee also was appointed, consisting of Mr. William Donnelly, Mr. John Ross Mahon, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Thomas Ball, to consider the best and simplest mode of drying the farina or potato flour, when obtained from the potato, and communicating it, together with such other information as might be collected upon the subject, to the public."
"Mr. Mahon called the attention of the council to the fact that the very best method of affording practical relief to the poorer classes in the approaching emergency would be by procuring plenty of employment for them, whereby they would not only relieve themselves and their families, but at the same time effect. some great permanent _ improvement in the country; and that this could not possibly be done in a more direct or effective way, than by calling the attention of the government to the necessity of some system of general drainage on an extensive scale, and of lowering the bed of the larger rivers, and their tributaries, so as to facilitate the removal of the water from those Tart tract* e< low land, which are now periodically inundated, and rendered useless at certain seasons, and which sever can be effected by private speculation or enterprise; and it being the general opinion of the council, that nothing would be more desirable than to combine employment with relief, and general improvement with both, similar to the course pursued in 1822, by government, when a great extent of roads were made, and whole districts opened by public money, in a time of similar distress; and the council being also of opinion, that there was no mode of"
"O  employing the public money better, or of affording rnore practical and immediate relief to the working classes, than by the adoption, by government, of a system of general drainage of the kind, free from all the trammels of private and individual interests which clog and obstruct the working of the present system; and, moreover, that it was an essential preliminary to improved husbandry in general, and more particularly to the system of thorough drainage of the land, so much advocated by the society, and now in such general practice throughout Ireland. For these reasons therefore it was—"
"Resolved—That a deputation from the Council should wait upon his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant, to press upon him the necessity of government taking immediate steps for procuring an extensive system of employment all through the country, as the only practical and effective means of guarding against the effects of the present evil; and that, in their opinion, no measure would be more likely to effect the object than the one proposed, which would not only give immediate employment and relief, but also effect the greatest permanent improvements in those very localities which require both the most. That a general system of drainage of the kind would also be in accordance with one of the primary objects of the society, namely, as auxiliary to thorough drainage of the land, by individuals, and to the act of last session for the purpose, upon which the future improvement and prosperity of this country now so mainly depend."
"The deputation was ordered to wait upon his Excellency the following day, at four o'clock, and the Council then adjourned until Thursday next."

May it please your Excellency:
"We, the Farming Society of Westmeath, assembled at our annual meeting, finding, from minute investigation, that the potato crop, the staple food of the majority of the people, has been destroyed to an alarming e by the prevailing disease, deem it of the greatest importance to call your attention to the fact, and to request that you will direct such measures to be taken as may be deemed expedient to make provision for the support of the labouring population during the coming summer, in the event of that necessity which we have much reason to anticipate."

"94  CORK AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY Farmers Gazette, November 1°, 1845, page 439"
The noble Chairman said they had derived much profit and pleasure from Mr. Jennings observations on a former occasion; and he would ask him to favour them them with a few remarks.
"Mr, T. Jennings said he rose under considerable disadvantage after Mr. Croker, but he could bear his testimony to the correctness of Mr. Croker's experience. Even when the potato was diseased only a small portion of the starch was affected, which would still produce food of a most nutrimental kind. It had been asked how the peasantry could dry the starch. It was not necessary to dry it, for it would keep for three months without injury if the water was changed once a fortnight, and it was better when mixed with flour than in its natural state. He had found that tubers dug ten days ago, and kept in a .dry place, were not in the least deteriorated, but in boiling the tubers they might be deteriorated. What Mr. Croker had stated with regard to the exemption of farina from the attacks of rats, was perfectly correct. It was as safe from them as if it was sand. They found practically what Magendie stated, that pure farina would not nourish the body; when mixed with oats, it made excellent food, but in itself it would not answer as an article of diet. What Mr. Croker had stated with regard to the supe- riority of the common horse potato producing more starch than the minion and finer kinds was also correct. The pure brown parts of the potato also might be grated for farina. The potatoes that contained the most nutritive qualities were not those that contained most starch, but the most gluten; however both were necessary. Slacked lime had been mentioned, but he thought lime reduced to powder was better for drying the tubers. Every barrel of lime would abstract eleven gallons of water, and they might use earth with the potatoes for sometime previously, only to avoid using water. He believed, however, that there was a sufficient crop for the country if they were used with economy, the alarming. It was the wasteful expenditure which caused the great loss of the potato. He recommended those who had spars to lay them on the ground and thus make houses at a moderate expense, with a thatch overall to keep out frost. By laying earth at the ends, and straw where they touch the ground, the potatoes could be placed there. if treated in the manner described they would be perfectly safe, and at a proper time could be pitted."
"Mr. Croker said those who put them into pits found them rapidly decay. A gentleman said if they were strewn ona bawn field they would be safe. Some said if they were left in the ground they would be injured by frost, but that could not happen, when they were kept from the light and the sun."
"Mr. Beamish exhibited the plan of a hurdle, two feet to two and a half in height, a sufficient number of which are to be laid two and two together, connected at top and separated at bottom, so as to form a flue the entire length of the bottom of the potato pit, which is to be made about eight feet wide (including the width of the flue) to be brought up to a point at top, covered with straw and thatched in the same manner as a hay rick. This was found in Scotland to be the best mode of preserving the turnips, and would most certainly be found of some efficacy in"
"OQ  preserving the potatoes from being destroyed by the present disease, provided they were put up in dry weather. The poor man might lay furze bushes to form the flue, which would be equally efficient for the purpose as the hurdles."
"Mr. Tim Murthy, a practical farmer, tenant to Mr. C. Beamish, said, that his object in attending the dinner was to learn the best mode of. saving the potatoes. He had forty acres of them, and three-fourths ere gone. He was no alarmist, nor did he wish to create any uneasiness in the public mind, but it was j to their central Board. necessary to state facts, and see what was best to be England: and ridone. He had the honor to address the wealth and talent of their great county that evening, and he expected he would have heard something better than that of making farina for the poor. He believed they could never induce the poor to convert potatoes into farina; they were not prepared for it, and it could not be done. The season was advancing, the potatoes should be dug, and what were they todo ? At all times potatoes were likely to rot in pits, if dug in wet, weather. He advised, as the best means to secure them, to dig in dry weather, and have two women to pick the potatoes after every man, separating such as appeared to be unsound. He understood that potatoes were being exported from Ireland — corn was rising — the price was remunerative— it would be sold and exported too."
"What were they to do ? Their esteemed chairman had set an example; his noble father had set many, he was the first in the county to raise the price of labour of the poor. Their chairman had succeeded in laying the first railroad in the south of Ireland, an act worthy of the noble family of which he was a member. He wished landlords would induce their tenantry not to dispose of their corn for the present, but hold it over, and to effect this the tenantry should not be pressed for the rent; 30s. per barrel was a fair price, and the tenants would be induced to sell, and if the potatoes became short, what would they then have to feed on ? Mr. Beamish boasted of the Scotch landlords, but let it never be said that the Irish Landlords were inferior to the Landlords of Scotland."
"Mr. Beecher said there were three fields in his district under potatoes, which had been similarly manured, and the ground of a like description: In two of those fields the stalks had been pulled, on the third they had not, the consequence was, that on the fields where the stalks had been pulled the potatoes were safe, while on the one unpulled the potatoes were gone. He wished to know the reason of that."
"Mr. Murphy said, it was stated that the disease was communicated to the bulb from the stalk. Now he did not think such was the case, for, on coming to Cork that day, he went into a field and pulled three potatoes, which he produced for the inspection of the meeting. He said it would appear from one that the disease was underneath the root, in another the disease was at the side, and so it was on the third one."
"Mr. Croker produced three other potatoes, showing that the disease commenced at the stalk; and it was known that the disease attacked the tuber in the most whimsical manner."
Mr. Beecher inquired of Mr. Jennings what portion of flour he recommended to be
96  used with the potato farina? _ > Mr. Jennings thought that equal portions were best.
"Mr. Biggs wished to state, that as the common mode of keeping potatoes was in pits, he recommended that for every barrel or forty-eight weights pitted, a shovel of slaked lime be strewn over them. He believed that was the most likely means to arrest the disease, which appeared to him to be something like dry rot, He re- commended, also, that straw be put over them, which would allow either evaporation or fermentation to escape. He believed that was the simplest way of preserving the potato. The results of their meeting that evening must be highly satisfactory, as it was evident, notwithstanding the alarming reports of the failure of the potato crop, that there was still a sufficiency of food for the poor, if proper"
measures were resorted to.
” The Chairman inquired of Professor Allman whether he considered slaked lime or sand best for preserving the potato.
"Professor Allman thought that any substance which had the effect of absorbing moisture would check the disease. Of sand or lime, perhaps the latter had the advantage; but on that he did not speak with certainty —he was open to correction."
"The Chairman said there was much practical information detailed to them that evening by eminent men, but it was not enough to read that in, the newspapers; more was to be done. The country agricultural societies should meet and discuss the subject; and the landlords should impress the necessity of it on their tenantry. But who were the landlords of Ireland 2 On this subject there was much ignorance manifest in England; it being believed there that the landlords here were similar to those in England, while the contrary was the fact, and it should be made known. The tenants here in many cases, held under a class of landlords who were little better than themselves. He contended that two thirds of the land in Ireland were held in that way, and by a class who were, unable to advance the interests of their tenants. At the present crisis the damage to the potato crop should be ascertained, and the people instructed as to the best plan of preserving what was sound. He conceived that the Boards of Guardians throughout the country were fit persons to institute inquiries on the subject. Many of them were often engaged in discussing extraneous matter—others absented themselves from the responsibility: and he thought they would be better engaged in making inquiry as to the injury of the potato crop in their respective Unions, and reporting the result to their central Board. That was the coarse pursued in England, and it should be done here, but not in such a manner as to create alarm. He observed from the papers, that the subject had been warmly taken up the Board of Guardians at Fermoy. He hoped that other Unions wonld follow their example."
"After some further conversation on the cultivation of flax, the meeting then ended."
"O  EDITORIAL IN FARMERS GAZETTE Farmers Gazette, November 1°, 1845, page 440"
"IT will be seen from the proceedings of the Royal Agricultural Society, that the subject hinted at in our last week's leading article, of procuring employment for the laboring classes in the present imminent circumstances of the country has been made a matter of discussion and a deputation has been appointed to wait on His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant to memorialize government for assistance in procuring labour for the working classes. This, we think, is setting about encountering the approaching crisis of scarce and dear food, so as to overcome .it in the way least painful for those upon whom; it must otherwise press most severely. It is perfectly evident that a considerable proportion of the potato crop is already destroyed, and what remains, is of a quality so inferior, that, as an article of human food, it would be unsafe to use it so abundantly as the poorer classes of this country have been in the habit of doing. Other kinds of food must, therefore, be had recourse to; but the price of provisions has risen to such a height, that the labourer's daily pittance of 10d or 1s. is wholly inadequate, to purchase a sufficiency for himself and family."
The loss of the potato crop must have the effect of diminishing the usual demand
"for agricultural labour, as most farmers will endeavour, as much as possible, to"
make up the loss they have sustained from the failure of the crop by increased
"economy in their farm operations. Many labourers must therefore, be thrown out of"
"employment, and unless supplied with it in some other way, their only resources"
"are the workhouse, and the charity of public bodies, or private benevelence. How,"
"none of these, however energetically brought into operation, can possibly be able"
"to clothe and feed the many thousands that must inevitably be thrown upon their _ charity, if there be no other mode of supporting them."
"Government can alone provide against the evils which threaten the country at present, and this it can do by a liberal grant of money, to set in active operation, a general system of deepening rivers, and draining and improving waste land, proprietors of land too poor to improve their estates, might also be encouraged by favourable loans to commence doing so. Many modes of employment would readily suggest themselves, provided the means of putting them in execution were supplied."
"We would, therefore, call upon the government, in the present juncture, to take the matter under its serious and immediate consideration; otherwise the country"
"must inevitably be plunged into an abyss of suffering, from which subsequent measures of relief may be ineffectual to rescue it."
"DISEASE IN THE POTATO CROP Farmers Gazette, November 1*', 1845, pages 441-442"
"SIR—As the disease in the potato is progressing to an alarming extent, I am induced to offer a few remarks should you think them worthy of insertion in your in-"
"98  valuable and widely-circulated paper. Although we have been silent here, I am disposed to believe, that in no other part of Ireland have they been visited more severe with that scourge than in this neighbourhood. I know of no farmer around me who is not loud in his wailing."
I will give you the particulars of how I stand myself. Ibekieve I m more favoured than some of my neighbours.
"I had about fifteen acres under potatoes which have been effectually thorough- drained and sub-soiled, and all lying in the same aspect, but possessing a variety of soils. The first three acres were planted: in lazy-beds, out of lea, in the beginning of April. I manured them plentifully with good farm-yard manure. The otter twelve acres were drilled; ten of those were manured from the farm-yard, the other two with road-scrapings, bog and lime mixed, all of which are affected. I mention those particulars to show you what a rapid progress the disease has made in one part of the crop towards the other, owing, in my opinion, to the different soil and manure which has been applied. I commenced raising them last week, and began with the three acres first put in, which were planted in lazy-beds. I went into the field with a determination of selecting the good from the bad; but I must acknowledge it was a task I could not perform, as I found, on a more careful examination, that the cull was not safe, as there were many amongst them affected more or less. Of the three acres which I selected in this way, the cull stood as one-fourth, which I will not say were all sound; the other three parts were very much affected, and turned blue from the nature of the disease. The potatoes planted on this part are nearly all what are called in this neighbourhood ""Sons to the Cups ""—a variety of the common cup and much resembling it—the other variety were affected nearly as much. I am taking up at present the main crop, which was planted in May: those on strong clay, manured from the farm-yard, are about one-fourth sound; those on moory ground, with farm-yard manure, scarcely one-half sound; those on a gravelly soil, manured with road- scrapings, bog, and lime mixed, and which were not put in until the first of June, fully three-fourths sound. The varieties least affected with me are, first, the red apple, second, the old cup, and next the pink-eye."
"I shall now give you my mode of treatment; as I am not prejudiced in favour of any single one, I am trying many that have been recommended, and shall lay the result of my experiments before the public after a little time. The mode I am adopting principally is simple, and within the reach of the poorer class of farmers to make use of; it is as follows:—Take up the potato as careful as possible, to prevent injury to their surface. I choose the driest and lightest soil in the field, and to that part I direct them to be carried, where I have in readiness, lime in powder, and dry sand. Underneath the potatoes I shake some of the lime, and as they are laid down I have two persons at the pit; one for dusting them over carefully with lime, the other is employed in throwing in sand, so as to prevent any of the potatoes from coming in contact with each other; the pits I make very narrow, and in this state I leave them exposed to the atmosphere during the day, until late in the evening; I then cover them lightly with earth. I believe the atmosphere has a beneficial effect on them. Those which I have dug and pitted, in this way, about six days ago, I examined this morning, and can find no marked change in them. I am of opinion they are no woise than when I dug them, I tried another"
"O  small pit which I did not .mix with anything, and found many of them covered with white spots, and some few in a putrescent state, those I believe to have been affected going in to the pit; however, I would strongly recommend to / all persoas, visited with this scourge, the necessity of using some dry and absorbent material; let it he used plentifully, as I am in hopes it may suspend the, disease until such time as those not badly affected can be made some use of. It is the opinion of many persons that the disease has come from the stalk; I am inclined to think otherwise, and that it has originated in some other way. From the time this opinion began to gain ground, I became a constant visitor in the potato fields of this neighbourhood, and often in company with other inquirers. I have carefully examined the stalks, and have found many which, to all appearance, were sound, but on examining the tubers, have found them affected. I have gone still farther with my inquiry — having planted some potatoes, in .a very warm situation, early last spring, I commenced to dig them the first of August. They were very fine, and had not the slightest appearance of disease amongst them; they were planted in lazy beds. It occurred to my mind, a few days back, that some of the potatoes had escaped the man's observation when first digging them, tad, that he had covered them up in the clay; I commenced immediately to dig those beds over again, and found many of them at different depths, all of which were quite unconnected with the stalk, since the beginning of August, of those which I collected, I found about one-fourth diseased."

POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, November 1°‘, 1845, page 442"
SIR—I am sorry to be obliged to confirm the truth of the many melancholy
"100  communications you are receiving, as to the general failure of the potato crop. In this neighbourhood it is now confirmed. I do not believe there is one field in the district that is not tainted. Many poor people who thought they had escaped, within the last two days—I may say twenty-four hours—have found them going fast. My own, and I never saw a finer crop turn out, are all in the same state, with the exception of some that I had planted in the subsoil of the furrows of early ridges. Since the ridges were dug in August, those in the furrows have had nearly eighteen inches of cover over them, and when dug they appeared quite dry. I am now planting cabbages, and between each I am planting a potato that appears sound, and placing some dry earth between it and the manure, intending to let them take their chance there for next season."
"God help the poor. It is melancholy to hear them speak of their loss. One poor man told me this morning, that ""though he might exist for a week or two without a potato, he did not think there would he the shadow of him on the earth after that."" They were his words. Surely no grain ought to be used in distilleries—"

DISEASE IN THE POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, November 1°, 1845, page 442"
"Sir—As it is desirable, that as much information as possible should he afforded, as to the state of the potato crop, from the so-called murrain, I beg to say, that in this neighbourhood its threatened destruction is very-extensive, amounting to one- fourth, or it may be one-third of the crop, taking for granted, that all the potatoes that are now injured will eventually rot."
"Although scarcely a field has escaped, yet circumstances appear to modify its effects. I have seen several fields sheltered by a wood or hill, from the north east, that have not more than one-fortieth marked, while the crop in those open to the north and east, have suffered most severely, and lea sowing, particularly where ashes was used as manure, are nearly all destroyed. In this neighbourhood the cup potato has escaped the best—the lumper, or white potato, has suffered most."
"It may be deemed presumptuous in so humble an individual to offer an opinion on the destroyer; but as the learned have signally failed as to fungi, parasites, and electricity, the microscope, chemistry and physiology, artotrogus, hydosporus- seporium and fusisporium, abstruse Greek, learned Latin, and far-fetched English, have only succeeded in making confusion worse confounded, it may be well to bring a little common-sence-experience into the field. :"
"It is a fact that we know little of the vital principle of tubers; but he must be a most fortunate potato-grower of ten years’ standing who has not had an ac- ‘quaintance with, the white or dry rot.* Now let anyone who has been so acquainted think for a little, and he will find the so-called murrain a very old acquaintance; he will find the same discolouration of the skin in the decaying parts—"
"©  the same dryness and whiteness in the destroyed portion—the same peculiar odour and absence of acidity in both the healthy and decayed places when boiled, and the same treachery in its sudden appearance in apparently healthy crops, that so unfortunately characterizes our present destroyer. There is but one well-marked difference, and that is, that 1 never before saw the rot in the crop before it was put together. The cause in the present state of vegetable chemistry and physiology, we cannot discover; our efforts should be then directed to prevent the evil spreading; and I would suggest, as most consonant with experience, to make the pits very smail, not putting more than from forty to forty-five stones of potatoes to every yard long, thorough-draining, and making vents as suggested in the GAZETTE of the IIth inst. As I never saw potatoes having the white rot make good seed, I much fear our next year's planting will miss sadly."
"Vegetable physiology and chemistry are still in their infancy; they are children of great and benevolent promise; but they cannot walk alone; they must be guided by experience, and if we now lean too firmly on them for support, we will only meet with disappointment, and may even crush them in our fall—"
"Yours, &c., B. H. T. Stradbally, October 28, 1845."
* So earned to distinguish it from the wet or black rot caused by the acetuous and destructive fermentation.
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, November 1°*, 1845, page 442"
"SIR—The writer of the following having been present at the Cork Agricultural Society's quarterly meeting, thought it a pity that the suggestions which fell from the different speakers should be lost, and presents them in a condensed shape, in the hope that they may prove useful to his fellow-countrymen.—"
"ist, Endeavour to have them dug in dry weather."
"2nd, Have them carefully picked on digging, and separate any that are diseased. 3rd, If the potatoes are tolerably dry and sound, they may be pitted in the following manner:—Place a tier of stones on the ground as large as the space intended to be occupied with potatoes, along the centre of which raise a heap of large stones of this shape; and having covered the stones with brambles and furze, pile the potatoes in the usual inamur cover them with straw and earth, leaving an open at each end of the stones to allow the air to circulate through the potatoes."
"4th, If the potatoes are moist, but sound, use un-slacked lime instead of stones in the centre of the heap: it will absorb the damp, render the potatoes dry, and less liable to decay; and in a few weeks the potatoes may be again picked and pitted with stones, as recommended above,"
"5th, Should parts of the potatoes be infected, have them grated or sliced oft'—the sound part will heal as well as the usual spade wound, by allowing them to remain for a few days."
"6th, Convert the diseased part, or any diseased potatoes, into farina, by the following process:—Grate the potato with a common grater—strain the produce to"
"102  separate the skin and fibre, which may be cooked for cattle and pigs—wash the fine part by stirring water in a tub or pan—allow it to settle, and remove the water (in a timber vessel, it can be done by a hole in the side and a plug). Repeat the washings until the water ceases to become red. The farina is then fit for use, and"
"may be removed to a store cask, where it will keep for a -long time, by keeping"
water on it and changing it once a week.
"7th, The farina may be converted into wholesome food, by mixing it with an equal proportion of wheaten flour, and made into bread with soda and buttermilk, and baked on a griddle. -"
"8th, On a large scale the potatoes may be reduced into pulp, by mounting a circular piece of timber, 18 inches long and 12 inches in diameter, with iron gudgeons and a handle, and covering it with sheet-iron, closely pinched, the rough side out. This is placed in a frame with a hopper for containing the potatoes, and a circular board, one-third of the circumference of the barrel, and against which it works; a joggling screen is placed underneath, worked by a crank on the handle for sifting the pulp. The finer part falls into a tub beneath, and the fibre and skin are thrown off the end of the screen. If practicable, a jet of water should play on the barrel when at work. The farina to be treated as directed in suggestion 6."
N.B—Diseased potatoes produce good farina. Be careful to avoid any waste.
"Yours, &c., Z., October 27, 1845."
DISEASE IN THE POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, November 15', 1845, page 442"
"Sir- I beg to acquaint you that all this part of the country is in a most dreadful state with the disease in the potato crop. It is really alarming; and if some means be not discovered, whereby to stop its progress, the destruction of this important crop, to a very serious extent, is inevitable. I commenced first to dig pinkeye potatoes for the Dublin market, on the second of this month, at which time I found a great many quite rotten. I picked about a barrel of them ; and having cut them into thin slices, laid them down on a barn floor, and strewed about a quarter of a stone of salt among them, making sure both sides of the sliced potatoes were equally salted. Two days after this had been done I went into the barn to look at them, but the smell was so offensive, that I could scarcely bear it. The salt had become dissolved, and was running all over the floor. The potatoes were allowed to remain in this state for two days longer, and on being examined then the smell was found entirely to have left them. I took them out, laid them in a small pit, and carefully covered the whole with straw and earth. On Saturday last I ex- amined them again, and found them quite safe: a little slaked June was then put amongst them; but, probably, they might have done without it. I have two or three hundred barrels of apple potatoes, the most of which are more or less affected. They have all been raised within the last fifteen days, and laid on dry straw in pits, at the rate of about two barrels to the yard, on a ridge having a fall to each side. The potatoes were mixed with alternate layers of straw, «wheat-chaff, and lime mixed j and I can safely assert, that since they"
"iS  were pitted, the disease has not become worse. I have thatched the pits about nine inches thick, with well-drawn straw, so as to prevent wet from getting access to the potatoes; and I intend to keep them in that state, until I am satisfied that they are beyond all danger, when I will cover them with a little more straw, and rope them firmly for the winter."
Trusting that these remarks may be of use to others.
"I remain, yours, &c., JAMES, Newlawn, near Swords, Oct. 30, 1845."
EXPERIMENTS WITH DISEASED POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, November 1*', 1845, page 442"
"SIR—About five weeks ago I put a.few disordered potatoes into a heap of air- slaked lime, two of which I left at your office yesterday. I was exceedingly glad to find, upon examination, from the time they were put in the lime, the disorder made no progress, but, the potatoes seemed to be much improved; their wounds were dried up, and they also got rid of the foul smell that is so peculiar to rotten potatoes this season. I boiled some of them, and after paring off the injured parts I found them as good for eating as if nothing had happened to them. From the confidence I have in Mr. Carroll, in addition to this little experiment, I have no hesitation in adopting his plan of liming the potatoes, as I think it is the most simple, and at the same time, the cheapest mode of preserving them. About four or five years ago I put a few potatoes into some pickle that was made for wheat, and, as well as I can recollect, they lay near a month in the pickle (I always made wheat-pickle strong enough to float an egg or a potato). The potatoes, in appearance, turned nearly white; I boiled a few of them, they were excellent food, but they were so highly salted that I could not eat more than one of them. I have, no doubt, if I had steeped them for some time in water, as they do with salt fish, they would be very good and wholesome food. No time ought to be lost in setting about the preservation of so valuable an article as the potato is to man and beast; those that are far gone ought to be converted into starch and dried, as directed in the GAZETTE; every means that human ingenuity can suggest ought to be immediately put in practice."
"I hope you will excuse me for occupying so much of your time and space. The subject treated of admitting of no delay, induces me to give my humble opinion."
"Yours, &c., JAMES MACKLEN, Edenmore, October 22, 1845."
"104  REPORT TO HIS EXCELLENCY BARON HEYTESBURY, LORD LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND"
"Farmers Gazette, November 1°', 1845, pages 442-443"
"Board Room, Royal Dublin Society, 29th October, 1845."
"MY LoRD—Having submitted to your excellency, in a former report, some preliminary instructions intended to prevent improper treatment of the potato crop still remaining unaffected, we now have the honor to lay before your excellency, our views regarding some processes of treatment for the potato, which appear to us to be of practical value and importance. :"
"We are deeply sensible of the incompleteness of form which this mode of presenting our results tp your excellency, necessarily assumes; but the exigencies of the case are such, that we consider it our highest dutv to bring at once under the notice of her Majesty government such principles or modes of practice as, upon due consideration, we feel ourselves authorised to recommend."
"We have been engaged in the investigation of various plans for preserving diseased potatoes, as proposed by other persons, or suggested by ourselves, and we have been collecting precise information as to the experience of others in their endeavours to arrest the progress of the disease. From all the results that we have obtained we feel justified in submitting to your excellency following observations : —"
"Plans of treatment have been proposed by persons possessing more or less of chemical knowledge in which, some acids are to be employed; in others alkaline liquors; and. in a third class. gasses, such as chlorine. These processes we dismiss from further consideration, as even did they, in the laboratory, answer the intended purpose, they are totally inapplicable to the circumstances of the produce of an entire country, and to a population such as that for whose welfare your excellency is so deeply anxious. Other methods, apparently more practical, consist in the treatment of the potatoes with chloride of lime (bleaching powder) and salt, either separate or in mixture. The result of our own experiments, and the evidence we have received concerning trials made by persons in whom we have full confidence, authorise us at once to recommend the rejection of those materials. We have found the decomposition of the potato to be decidedly accelerated by their application. With respect to lime, the results of our own experiments are not yet decisive; nor is the experience of others as yet satisfactory. We therefore reserve this point for further consideration."
"Whilst the disease is not yet very far advanced in the potato, it is certain, that after being boiled or steamed, it may be employed as food for immediate use, both for man and other animals, without prejudice to health."
"When the disease is more advanced, so as to have invaded a large part of the"
"O  potato, and when the tubers have acquired a disagreeable smell, their influence on the system is more questionable. We have put in operation a series of experiments, in order to determine this point, and will, in due time, report the result to your excellency. As, however, the potato, when once affected, quickly runs into total decomposition if left to itself, it is evident that its consumption, merely for the purpose of food, cannot be sufficiently rapid; and it, therefore, becomes necessary to consider to what other uses it may be applied. ."
"The extraction of starch from potatoes, and its use as food, having strongly attracted public attention, and conflicting, and, in many cases inaccurate opinions having been entertained on this subject, we consider it of paramount importance at once to direct your excellency's attention to the actual state of knowledge regarding this material. It is recognised that the potato in relation either to its weight or bulk, is one of the most inferior articles of food. In its ordinary state of sound constitution, every hundred pounds by weight of potatoes contain, on an average seventy-four pounds of water; of skin and fibrous matter, eight pounds; and of starch, sixteen pounds; whilst of gluten, the most nutritious of vegetable matters, and which predominate in corn, there is not more than two pounds in the above quantity. It is quite certain that starch, or materials corresponding to it, exist to _ acertain amount in every variety of useful food; but it is equally certain that in food, starch is not the material which serves for the support of the animal frame; and an animal fed merely on starch dies of starvation nearly, if not quite as soon as if totally deprived of food. Hence, starch extracted from the potato cannot be viewed as a substitute for the potato itself: and we consider it of great importance that while the attention of the people is directed to the real value of starch, and the uses to which it may be advantageously applied, they should not be allowed to rest their hopes of nourishment during the succeeding season upon any of it alone."
"With this preliminary caution, we have to state to your excellency that probably the best use to which diseased potatoes may be applied is the extraction of starch. In a commercial point of view, the starch represents a considerable proportion of the value of the potato although it is not present in a large a quantity in unsound tubers as in those which are free from disease. The extraction is simple, and consists in processes which we need not here describe, as they are given in the current publications of the day, and indeed are practiced in most parts of the country."
"Your Excellency is aware that we are directing our attention to the manner in which starch can be advantageously employed. It can be worked off, and with utility, as food, when mixed with proportions of oatmeal, bean-meal, or peas-meal, and such intermixture forms an excellent and economical article of food. It is also to be remarked, that the pulp remaining after the extraction of the starch from the diseased potatoes, contains a considerable quantity of nutritive material; and as the decomposing substance is, to a very great extent, washed out during the preparation, the pulp may, when dried, be applied with confidence to the nourishment of animals. Further, if the dried starch, extracted from the potato, be mixed up with the dry residual pulp a"
"106  material will be produced really representing the potato, equivalent to it as food, and, if kept dry, capable of being preserved for a considerable length of time; sound it, of course, must be prepared for use by cooking or baking in the ordinary way. -"
"The manufacture of the pulp and starch, on an extensive scale, in accordance with these suggestions, we venture to consider worthy of your excellency's attention. It is an operation not suited to the circumstances of isolated cotters, and just now might not be a proper object for mere commercial speculation. But arrangements might possibly be made for carrying out this recommendation, through the agency of the poor law unions, and other government establishments, in which mechanical power and_ intelligent superintendence could be speedily and economically applied. We feel, however, that even these facilities for the conversion of the tubers may not be sufficient to keep pace with the progressive injury which, it is to be feared, the potato crop is sustaining. We, therefore, recommend a mode by which we believe the process of decomposition may be retarded. In our preliminary report, we mentioned to your excellency the important influence exercised upon the disease by moisture and dryness. Our subsequent investigations have confirmed this opinion, and we believe where means exist for a more complete drying of the tubers, such a method will prove the most efficacious plan for preserving the potato from further decay. This more perfect drying cannot, however, be effected in this climate by mere exposure to air, it requires artificial heat, applied in some form of kiln; and without entering into mechanical details, we may name some simple contrivances which seem well adapted to the purpose."
"In all these modes of drying, the potato should be cut into two, or if very large, into three pieces, so as to allow the water to escape."
"Potatoes dried in any of the modes above described are certainly capable of being preserved when kept in a dry place, and stored, with the precautions described in our first report, until suitable opportunities, arise for using them directly as food, or for converting them into starch or meal, according to the degree in which they were affected by the disease."
"The corn kilns extensively distributed through the country may at once be applied to the drying of the potatoes, which will, however, demand a temperature, rendered gradually higher than that required for corn. But as in many cases those kilns are at present fully occupied, we would represent that every lime kiln may be adapted to the purpose, without interfering with its ordinary operations, by erecting over it, at a suitable height above its mouth, a frame-work of hurdles, upon which the potatoes may be spread in a thin layer, fresh potatoes being added as the others become dry and are removed. In localities, where the previous means do not exist, or may not be on a sufficiently extensive scale, potatoes might be spread on a frame-work of hurdles, supported on a few props of stone, two or three feet high; one or more turf fires burning slowly under the hurdles, would effect the same object. There need be no fear of the potatoes becoming slightly browned, as they are not injured thereby for future use; and the turf smoke would act favourably on the"
O  potatoes rather than otherwise.
"It is gratifying to us to find that our own opinion as to the advantages of thoroughly drying the potato in the manner we have recommended, and by processes such as those above described, are confirmed by the experience of highly intelligent persons, who have simultaneously directed their attention to the subject."
"We shall not hesitate to bring under the notice of your Excellency, our further conclusions, and, we have the honor to be,"

THE POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, November 1°, 1845, page 443"
"The following modes of treating diseased potatoeshave been recommended by Charles William Hamilton Esq., to be adopted by the tenantry on the estates for which he is agent:— ."
"You naturally look to me for advice as to the best means of saving ihe potato crop; I regret to say, that from so many accounts of different modes of treating the potatoes, it is very hard to gather what is the best advice, but most people seem to agree in the following:—"
"ist—Exposure to light and dryness are most essential. You will find that the rot does not spread in the potatoes that are left lying on the ridge, you should therefore avoid heaving them in large heaps or pits, and do not store them in your dwellings."
"Those who have dry out-houses should put the potatoes in them with layers of dry turf mould or sand between each layer, and sprinkle them with well slacked lime. Those who have no out-houses, should make the pits as high and dry as they can and very dry."
"2nd—A rotten potato will communicate the rot to a sound one, therefore you should often look over them, pick out those which begin to be spotted, cut off the tainted part, and use them first."
"3rd—You will find that the green potatoes that have grown over the covering on the sides or tops of the ridge, and so got the sun, do not decay; pick them out and save them for seed."
108  POTATO CROP — KILN DRYING AS A PRESERVATIVE — PRACTICAL SUCCESS OF IT
"Farmers Gazette, November 1°, 1845, page 443"
(from Saunders Newsletter)
"In the observations which you inserted from me in your paper of Tuesday, 21st instant. I endeavoured to fix attention prominently on these three points :-—"
"4st. That extraction of the fecula from the potato would not be an advisable proceeding, as fecula or starch will not constitute a wholesomie or sufficient food; the people would not live in health on it—it would not be at all a substitute for the potato itself. ; , ;"
"2ndly. That whatever mode of preservation be employed, it is absolutely requisite that the main constituents or elements of the potato, consisting of fecula gum, oil, gluten, fibre, and salts, &c., be preserved: and—"
"3rdly. That kiln drying presents the quickest, most certain, and cheapest mode of attaining the desired end, viz., of preserving the potato, and of retaining all its constituents."
"In support of the first position, I hope I have brought forward sufficient proof in the communication referred to."
The admission of the second position necessarily follows on the establishment of the first.
"Of the third point—the proposal of kiln-drying—it may be said, that however apparently unobjectionable it may seem in principle, and however strongly supported by analogy and reasoning, it still labours under the deficiency of wanting the great proof of its feasibility and utility, viz., practical experience of its successful application."
"This deficiency has been supplied much sooner than I could have anticipated. In the Cork Constitution of the 21st instant, there is an account of a meeting of the Board of Guardians on the previous day, at which the Rev. Mr. O'Regan handed in a paper written by an intelligent farmer, who did not wish his name to be mentioned. I would wish to draw particular attention to this document. It supplies the required, proof of the efficacy of kiln-drying as a preservation of the potato, and it affords most useful information as to a mode of making a bread from potato, that will be, for the working classes, now, and in all future years, far superior to the potato in its ordinary simple boiled state :—"
"This plan about being read to you, of converting your diseased potatoes as well as your sound ones into good substantial food, is offered to your notice by one who has tried and proved the thing. There is no uncertainty in it; any farmer amongst you can try the affair, and one week will enable him to judge. Commence the trial to-morrow on your diseased potatoes on so small a scale, and next Sunday you will be able to say whether the boiled lumper or the food obtained from the diseased potato is best."
"O  Treatment of the diseased potato—Get any quantity of them, let them be well trashed, then pare all the skin off as far as they appear diseased, let them then be cut into slices one quarter of an inch thick*, let them be washed again until the water comes from them as clear as it goes on; let them be thrown into sieves or strainers, or on a door, settled on an inclined plane, which will cause the water to drain off them quickly. They must remain in this state until perfectly dry, after which they are put on a kiln or stove, turned often and allowed to remain on until the slices are as dry and brittle as is possible to make them without discolouring the potato, remove them from the kiln, and whilst hot, they are to be broken, they will break readily if acted on whilst so. After being allowed to cool in an airy room or loft, they are ground or crushed into meal, which, if manufactured into biscuit with pure cold water, without salt or barm, produces a substantial, well-tasted biscuit, such as I have known to remain sound and sweet for six months."
"The Sound Potato—-When they first come in, or are new, and before the skin thickens on them, they are to be washed as before stated, the eye of the potato removed as there is always a quantity of sand or other matter ramining in them. Should they appear with scab or anything that would discolour the meal of the potato, when, ground they must, of course, be cut or scraped off, and then go through the very same process as the diseased ones—there is no need whatever of paring the skin off this potato (the new one), nor is it necessary to pass the meal of this potato through a flour screen; but if the skin is thick as when the potato gets old it must then be pared off before slicing them (which will cause great waste, but not a total loss, as the pig will eat the paring), or if dried on them and ground with them, the meal must then be passed through a flour-screen, not too finely wired; the meal will be excellent, and the offal, or bran I may call it, is the best food the pig can get."
"I attach great value to the above communication. Independently, even of the Rev. Mr. O'Regan's statement, that it comes from a trustworthy person. I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction that it bears intrinsic evidence of being written by a person who could only have drawn up the details in that paper after long continued observation; and who has had, I am confident, ample experience in manufacturing potato bread; I would refer, in proof of this, to the minuteness of detail relative to the thickness of the sliced potato to prevent discoloration; to the use of hair-cloth, placed on the surface of the kiln, which acts by preventing any confinement of warm moisture between the lower surface of the potato and the tile, the effect of which, if not prevented, would be to steam or stew the potato; the washing and draining on an inclined plane, to remove any Impurities and disagreeable bitter that might otherwise remain in the meal, and the directions about the baking, &c."
"These are all details which, ""a priori,"" calculation could never provide for, and which bear intrinsic evidence ,of their value, for they carry on their face, the plainest reasons for their, employment. Were there to be from this moment a cessation of all injury to the crop, I would still think that the general adoption of the above plan of making potato bread would be a great improvement in the food of the labouring classes of our people, as well as tend to improvements in other respects in their habits."
"110  I would now, in concluding, ask of those who write on the subject to be accurate in the use of terms, as inaccuracy may mislead the public at large on some very important practical points. The fecula obtained from potatoes is, constantly Called ""potato flour."" It is not flour at all; it has no pretensions to the title. Wheaten flour is properly called flour, it contains all the constituents of the grain. But wheaten starch is not wheaten flour; neither is potato starch, potato flour. A loaf of wheaten starch would be but a poor substitute for a loaf of wheaten flour; just so would a cake of potato starch be but a sorry substitute for potato loaf. Were, this inaccuracy not corrected, it might lead many a benevolent individual to suppose that he was manufacturing out of the potato a “wholesome flour,"" as the papers so often call it, when he was only making bad arrow root or poor starch, an article on which neither health nor even life could be long sustained. For the proofs in support of this opinion, must beg to refer to my former communication."
"D. J. CORRIGAN, M.D."
"Notes: On no account, if you wish to have the meal a good colour and well tasted, cut the slices thicker than a quarter of an inch, as, if too thick, they will, before being sufficiently dried, become discoloured, and obtain an unpleasant taste."
"If the kiln or stove had a hair cloth (cocoa mat would be cheaper, and answer as well) laid on the tiles under the sliced potato, it would be the greatest possible improvement to the meal, both as regards taste and quality."
"Grinding is, no doubt, the best plan, and could not be done without, if a quantity was about bemg prepared—if crushed, small lumps will remain in spite of you and do great injury if the biscuit is meant to be kept for a long time."
"The biscuit must be baked with a strong heat (such as ship bread bakers use) and well stoved; after being baked, all depends on the drying of the slices before-being ground, and storing the biscuit when baked."
AUTUMN AND SPRING PLANTING OF POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, November 1°, 1845, page 444"
"In October last I prepared my land, and panted my potatoes in drill-rows, of thirty - inches width, applying fold-yard manure below the sets, but leaving three rows unplanted for each intermediate month between October and April, inclusive. The land is a strong loam, except at the tipper end, where it touched for a few yards upon clay, in which the potatoes failed to a great extent in all the plantings. At the lower end of the rows the land is good, and perfectly uniform. The manure and treatment of all was alike, in every respect, except as to the time of planting. This year I did not apply guano in the spring, as detailed in the experiments of last year. None of the potatoes have been affected by disease; but the earliest planted showed the greatest strength and vigour in the stems, although there were occasional vacancies in the rows. The land was all drilled up in October, at which time the largest part was planted. Three rows more were dunged and"
"O  planted in like manner, in the end of November; and three in the end of December. In January and February the weather was so bad, and the frost so hard, that no planting could be accomplished. Three rows more ware planted early in March, and the remainder of the land at the usual time of planting in April."
"The potatoes have been taken up within the last three days; and, to test the comparative produce of the several plantings, my man began at the low end of the rows, and dug onwards, till he had filled a sack, which contains 10 stones weight. The content, however, is immaterial, so long as the same sack was used for all. The average length of the drill rows, required to fill the sack —"
"Of October planting, was 30 yards; Of November ,, 32 yards; Of December ,, 32 yards; Of March “ 44 yards; Of April “ 45 yards;"
"which leaves to the October planting an increase of one-third over that of April, a result not very different from that of last year, in which the quantities were 111 to 86. From this it would seem that it does not much signify at what period in the winter potatoes are planted, provided the land be free and dry, and the weather suitable for working it; but it is evident that a loss of power is sustained by allowing the seed to remain in pits till the spring, under a slow process of vegetation, when, before being used in the field, considerable shoots have already been put forth, wasting the nourishment which is requisite to sustain the plant in its early growth, and before it begins to derive its support from the soil. A few more such experiments may tend still farther to elucidate this important subject —"

My Lord - We have had the honour to lay before your excellency reports on the
"diseases in. the potato crop, which have been extensively distributed throughout the country. Representations, however, have been made to us that the recommendations, being, in the form of reports, are not likely to be, of that use which the more simple form of instructions might enable them to be. We have, therefore, thought it advisable to prepare the accompanying directions, in the hope that the methods recommended may be easily, understood and promptly carried into execution."
We shall immediately lay before your excellency our views upon the course which
"112  should be pursued with regard to seed for a future year.—We have the honour to be your faithful and obedient servants,"
"ROBERT KANE, JOHN LINDLAY, LYON PLAYFAIR"
ADVICE CONCERNING THE POTATO CROP TO THE FARMERS AND TO THE ' PEASANTRY OF IRELAND
"The dreadful disease that has attacked your potatoes is one, the effects of which you can only stop by strict attention to, the advice of those interested in your wel- fare. Many plans have been proposed, and, after examining them all, we recommend the following as the best."
"All competent persons are of opinion, that the first things to bear in mind are the following directions: —"
"1. Dig your potatoes in dry weather, if you can; and if you cannot, get them dry somehow as fast as you can. ;"
2.Keep them dry and cool.
"3.Keep the bad potatoes separate from the good,"
4. Do not pit your potatoes as you have been accustomed to do in former years.
"5. Recollect that if they get damp, nothing can makethem keep; and do not consider them dry unless themould which sticks to them is like dust."
6.Do not take them into your houses unless you want them for immediate use.
"Digging and Drying.—As you dig the potatoes, leave them in the sun all day; and, if you can, throw them upon straw, turning them over two or three times. At night you may gather them together, and cover them with straw, so as to keep off frost. Next day take off the straw, spread them out, and give them the sun again. Do this for three days running, if the weather permits. If you put straw enough upon them at night they will not suffer."
"If the weather be unfavourable, and you have a dry loft, or out-house, large enough to hold them, you may spread them thinly on the floor, allowing free circulation of air, so as to dry them there."
They must be got dry.
"Sorting the Potatoes.—As soon as they are dry you must sort them. Pick them one by one, and put one heap the very bad ones, in another, those which are not so bad, and in a third, those that are sound. Treat the bad potatoes as shall afterwards be directed, and store the sound ones according to the directions given in the next paragraph. You will know the very bad potatoe sby their unpleasant smell, and the second set by their skin looking brown, or dull, and not bright, as it"
generally does; a very little practice will teach you how to distinguish them easily from each other.
"Storing—When the potatoes are quite dry and well sorted, proceed to store them"
"thus:—Mark out on the ground a space as long as you please. Dig a shallow trench two feet wide, all round and throw the mould upon the space; then level it, and"
"O  cover it with a floor of turf sods laid on their edges, On this sift, or spread very thinly the dry mixture, or any of the dry materiaks described below, and which you may call the packing stuff. Also et some dry slaked lime and dust all the potatoes with it as well as you can. Then put one row of turf sods, laid flat on the top of the floor, all around the sides so as to form a broad edge and within this, spread the dry potatoes mixed well wilh the packing stuff, so as not to touch one another. When you have covered the floor in this manner, up to the top of the sods, lay another row of sods all round the first, so that half of each sod may rest on the bed of potatoes, and the other half on the first layer of sods; this will make another edge one sod deep, which must be filled up with dry potatoes and dry packing stuff as before, Then lay another edge of sods in the same way, fill it again, and so on untill the heap is made. When the building of this pit is finished, it may be covered with sods at the top, and will be ready for thatching. If rightly made, it will look like the roof of cottage cut into steps."
"If you do riot understand this, ask your, landlord or clergyman to explain its meaning, and we are sure that they will give you every assistance: also recollect that the recommendation applies only to sound tubers after being well dried."
"You will lose nothing by applying these materials in storing, for the turf can be burnt as you use up the potatoes and the mixtures of lime with dry sand, dry clay or ashes, which you are afterwards directed to employ; will form a good manure after having saved the potatoes. The only difference is, that you must get what you want now instead of waiting till another time."
"After you have completed the heap, thatch it so as to throw off the waters into the ditch, and keep out the frost."
"In districts where there may not be spare turf sufficient to form the pits in the above way, make them as follows—Mark out the spot, and make the trench as before. Lay on the ground a floor of stones, about as large as apples, and over them as much heath, brushwood, or twigs, as will just cover the stones. On this floor form the heaps of potatoes, and packing stuff, just as described for the turf-pit. Cover the sides of the potatoes with more of the packing stuff, and thatch it in the, usual way."
We must again impress upon you that to pit potatoes in your usual way is certain destruction to them.
"Packing Stuff. This, which is of the greatest consequence, may be prepared in either of the following ways—some of you may prefer one, some the other:—"
"First way—Mix a barrel of freshly-burned, un-slacked lime with two barrels of sand or earth, as dry as you possibly can get it. The lumps of lime should be broken into pieces as large as marbles, and the mixture should, be left twenty-four hours; at the end of that time turn the heap well over, mixing together the lime and sand (or other dry materials, till no lumps of lime can be found."
"Second way—Mix well equal quantities of earth and broken turf, or dry sawdust; put a few sods of lighted turf on the ground; place the mixture on them; -by degrees, till"
"114  a large heap is made; in a few hours the fire will have spread through the heap, which is then to be covered with earth, so as to put out the fire. In fact, this is to be managed just as if you were burning land. This burned mixture forms a very good kind of packing-stuff, perhaps as good as the mixture of lime with dry - materials."
"What to do with Bad Potatoes When potatoes are only slightly diseased—that is, when the disease shows itself only under the skin in small, dark spots, or, at most, spreading into the substance of the potato, for about a quarter of an inch deep, with a yellow, or light brown, or blackish colour, and without any smell, they may be eaten by the family without danger. They should be peeled, and the diseased parts pared off before they are boiled; the parts cut off should be kept for making starch. Potatoes thus treated are wholesome and palatable; but should be used for food as quickly as possible, as it is not quite certain that they will keep long with"
the greatest care.
"It is a pity to destroy, potatoes for starch if they will otherwise keep. Cut out the diseased parts, if it can easily be done, and dust over the cut parts with lime and the potato also. Get them dry as soon as you possibly can; and if you have- outhouses or sheds, you should keep, the potatoes in them also, using the packing maierials. In such cases, you should allow the air to circulate freely in the sheds, and should frequently examine your potatoes, which should not be laid in layers above two or three feet in height. If you turn them frequently during the first two or three weeks and keep them very dry, in this way they will probably keep. Although sheds or outhouses are to be preferred if you have them not and cannot construct them out of cheap materials you should store the diseased potatoes by themselves _ just as we have recommended you to store the sound ones."
"if, with all your care, the diseased potatoes still get worse, dry them thoroughly in kilns, or on hurdles placed over lime Kilns, or on screens or hurdles placed over low turf fires, after having cut the potatoes into two or three slices. It is only very bad potatoes that you, should break up into starch."
"How to save the value of very bad Potatoes: Although nobody knows how to make bad potatoes into good ones, or to prevent many of them from becoming worse; yet it is impossible to extract from bad potatoes, or from bad parts of them, a great deal which is good. For this purpose, proceed as follows. Provide your selves with the following things, a rasp or grater, which may be made of a sheet of tin or even of sheet iron bent round, and punched full of holes with a nail—a common coarse linen cloth, or hair sieve, hand sieve, or common cloth strainer—and a pail, or tub or two to hold water."
"To make the bad potatoes useful, wash them clean, and then rasp them into one of the tubs of water; the finer they are rasped the more food will you procure from them. Having rasped a good many, take the cloth and place it on another tub, then put the pulp on the cloth, and pour water on it, allowing the water to run through. You have now two things to attend to— the pulp and the starch."
"First-Attend to the pulp, squeeze out as much water as you can from what remains on the cloth. You should wash it, however, till no smell remains. After you have squeezed it pretty dry, complete the drying on a girdle over a slack"
"O  fire, and when it is dry put it aside for use."
"Next look to milky water, it will then become clear, and the milkiness, which is the starch will have settled to the bottom, Pour off the water gently till the starch is tolerably well drained; then add more water, stir the whole well up and let it settle again. As soon as it is again clear pour off the water and when you have got rid of as much as you can, put the wet lumps of starch on a shef or other place to dry. In a few days it will be fit to pack up."
"Good wholesome bread may be made by mixing the starch with the dried pulp, peasmeal, beanmeal, oatmeal or flour. You must bear in mind that starch is not food by itself. :"
"There will be, of course, a good deal of trouble doing all that we have recommended, and perhaps at first you will not succeed very well at first, but we are confident that all true Irishmen will exert themselves, and never let it be said, that in Ireland the inhabitants wanted courage to meet difficulties against which other nations are successfully struggling."

"PRESENT DISEASE IN POTATOES, WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR PREVENTING ITS RECURRENCE"
"Farmers Gazette, November 8°"", 1845, pages 452-453"
"Many causes have been assigned for the, present lamentable disease in potatoes, many, explanations given respecting its nature, and many plans suggested to ar- rest its progress, and prevent its recurrence; yet, amidst all the ingenious theories invented on the subject, numerous as they are, none appear to possess the least merit, either in accounting for the disease, or proposing a remedy. Drought, sunshine, rain, cold winds, thunder and lightning, and every other kind of meteorological phenomena, have all and each been accused of the induction of this national calamity and apparently without any reasonable grounds. Twenty years ago, when the disease was not known, the same weather prevailed that does now; or, if the climate of the country be changed, and either its present, colder temperature, or its most abundant moisture, or any of the other causes adduced, is to be considered as having generated the disease, at least, that particular cause, has not prevailed in every country through which the disease extends. According to the accounts we receive from England, Holland, Belgium, Poland, France, and America, the potatoes there have suffered quite as much as in Ireland, yet, the weather, in those countries, situated so differently to what this is, must have been different; hence, if too much rain, and too great a degree of cold, have produced the disease here, they could not be alleged to have brought it on in France, Poland, and America, where the climate, during the summer, is usually much hotter and dried, and where no exception has been made, so far as I am aware of, to the general rule, in respect to the present season. We cannot receive the supposition as tenable, that the disease, which seems to be the same"
"116  everywhere (for it presents, exactly the same physical characters in all places), should have been occasioned here by one cause, and, in another country, by a cause diametrically opposite."
"Rather let us confess our ignorance immediate cause, and attribute, the predisposing disposition of the potato to contract disease to the artificial and unnatural habits which cultivation during a long succession of years, and has made it to assume, and which, weakening or changing the organic texture of the plant, permitted the slightest injury, of whatever sort it might be, to operate as a proximate cause in the production of the disease. This view of the subject is corroberated by the circumstance of the gradual increase of the disease, season after season, for the last dozen years. It is a notorious fact, that the disease as far as back .as the time I have specified; but, as it was then trifling, it was. not so much noticed. It is also founded on truth, that, since then, it has been spreading to a greater and greater extent. Not only in this country, but abroad, the disease was met with about twelve years ago. St. Helena, an island situated 15 degrees south of the equator, but possessing in the high lands an European climate, although in the tropics, has always been a great place for the cultivation of the potato, to supply, with that useful vegetable, the numerous ships which call there. In the year 1830, the disease was first noticed there; and as they have two crops a year on the island, the progress of the disease was, perhaps, more closely watched there than here. Every succeeding year became worse and worse, until 1841, when potatoes had risen to the enormous price of 25s, per cwt; which, induced merchants to send some vessels from Jersey, and, I think, from Scotland, freighted with potatoes to St. Helena. Such of the potatoes as stood the long voyage of three months must, of course, have been extremely good; and these being employed for seed, along with others procured from ships from Van Dieman's Land, quite changed the aspect of affairs on the island as regarded the potato. The crops, of 1842 were much better than those of the preceding year, although there still existed some rot; and, in the following year, the improvement was still more striking. This circumstance will show, that the old seed, from constant culti- vation, had become impaired in its reproductive qualities, and required to be changed."
"Two singular circumstances, which it may be interesting here to relate, as they may serve as useful cautions in the present emergency, attended the rot in potatoes in St. Helena. The first was, that the-disease always appeared when the plants TcT* about fifteen inches high, and beginning to flower. The disease first manifested itself in the stalk, usually at about an inch from the root. The appearance presented there was, as if the stalk had been eaten away or corroded - something like ulceration in the human. In two days the plants drooped, and the whole field looked brown and withered. When examined, the fibres of the roots were always found decayed, as if they were blue-moulded; and the small tubers, the size of marbles, were usually soft and putrescent. The more rapid disorganization of the root in St. Helena than what occurs here, may, in some measure, be accounted for by the greater heat there, which is so favourable to the decomposition of vegetable substances. The second circumstance I wish to impress seriously on the attention, inasmuch as it may serve for a useful lesson, on the present occasion, is the coincidence of the disappearance of the seed-vessel (commonly called the potato apple) with the introduction of the disease; such that, during the last twelve years it was rare to"
"O  meet with a potato apple—although the healthy plants would bear plenty of bossoms, yet these would never be succeeded by seed-vessels, as in the natural order of things. Indeed, it was a common remark, among the farmers, that, during the last twelve years, they scarcely ever saw a potato apple, though previously they were as common in the field as they are here now. Should it unfortunately happen, that the potatoes here, for the future, become affected in a similar manner, we shall be debarred from availing ourselves of, perhaps, the most natural method of restoring the healthy condition of the plant, viz., from the seed in the apples. And should this take place, it will be an additional reason to adopt the method which I am about to propose, which, as it is founded on the natural habits of the plant, I have reason to hope will be found to be successful."
"Little - will it avail - as to know, that the disease is a parasite vegetable, a cryptogamic fungus, preying upon its parent,’ in the same way that mosses and mistletoe grow upon oaks, feeding on their nourishing juices; that it is a degeneration of the cellular tissue of the tuber, in the same manner that cancer is an alteration of the organization of the skin, flesh, or the other textures that it attacks; or that if consists of myriads of poisonous animalculis, contaminating the root with their venom. All these speculations may serve to amuse the philosopher, but can be of little benefit to the farmer, or to the community at large. By his minute investigations with the microscope, the philosopher is as liable to be led into error as to arrive at the truth. What one may imagine to be an animalcule, may be considered by another to be a vegetable molecule, and by a third, to be merely an atom of matter; and these hypotheses may be formed, and superstructures of nonsense built up, endeavouring to explain what nature has intended, perhaps, shall always be involved in mystery. When the microscope was invented, it was expected that everything would be discovered by its use; but ex- perience has taught us to place very little dependence on the information it elicits. So very subject are our own senses to be deceived, when employing that instru- ment; that it has served as much to induct us into error, as to clear up our doubts. If it has increased to a wonderful extent, the sphere of our observation, it has, unfortunately, not augmented the limits of our knowledge in proportion."
"As to the propositions offered to the public, respecting the means recommended to be adopted, to arrest the disease, and prevent its occurrence, all of them having been founded’ on partial views, and isolated experiments, must be regarded as delusive, and, therefore, rejected as worse than useless. One farmer will tell you that he has saved the field by dipping the cut surface of the seed into lime; previously to planting them. Another relates that salt, soot and chloride of lime are specifics. Others, again, are infatuated with the protective powers of guano, and declare that it is a sovereign remedy. It is rather curious that the same substances, which have been advocated as useful, have again been stigmatized as injurious. On all the manures above-mentioned has the imputation been cast of producing- the disease; and none of them have been accused to the same extent as guano; so that the same article which is considered by one to be, above all others, useful, is reckoned by another, to be preeminently hurtful. The fact is, no reliance can be placed on any sort of manure, or any peculiar plan of agriculture, to avert the evil, which has been nearly everywhere alike injurious."
"The only reasonable method from which success can be expected to be-derived, is"
118  to restore to the cultivated plants original nature and I shall presently explain how this is to be effected.
"All wild plants, and even animals, become changed in their characters, and frequently deteriorated, by their. removal from their native soils, and climate, by their cultivation, or, in the case of the last, by being domesticated. Numerous analogies might be furnished; by both the vegetable and animal kingdoms, to prove this assertion. Trees, native of the tropics, will not flourish in northern climes; the cocoa-nut, date-tree, the coffee, and castor-oil tree will, not live, exposed to the cold .and frost of Ireland. Plants, which have been introdiiced here from foreign parts, require constant attention and in spite of hot houses and horticultural skill, usually degenerate. Trees become shrubs, when transplanted from a hot to a cold country; and these, by removal to a region colder still, are converted into annual herbaceous plants. All our fruit trees are originally natives of the temperate parts of Asia. In Persia, and the north of Hindustan, the peach, apricot, nectarine, almond, and pium trees, annually shed their seed, contained in the fleshy pulp of the fruit; and, from the kernels, young plants spring up in the succeeding spring, by the unaided efforts of nature. The kernels, deposited in the earth, in England, will not, however, germinate, owing to the inclemencies of the weather; and other means have to be resorted to, in order to continue their reproduction. A wild stock, of a similar nature, as a wild cherry-tree, has to be planted first, and a slip of the cultivated fruit-tree is grafted on it, living and bearing fruit by means of the nutritious juices derived from the roots of the wild plant. In the same manner, a garden rose-bush has to be budded, or grafted, on a wild dog-rose, or briar. Many indigenous plants, found on hedge-rows, roadsides, and banks of streams, where they flourish in all their vigour, when removed into gardens, lose many of their hardy qualities and have their - natural organization modified. The common heather, which requires nothing for its growth but a poor soil, and a bleak atmosphere, invariably decays, when transplanted into a rich, warm locality."
"_ With respect to the animal kingdom, have vre not heard it a& an undisputed fact, that lions, tigers,leopards, monkeys, and other wild animals, which are brought here from foreign parts, generally contract disease after a short residence ? A few years ago it used to be the custom, among captains of vessels trading to the West Indies, to take a score or two of dogs with them, as a small speculation, on their own account. So many of the dogs died from the effects of .the climate, that the trade is now abandoned; and the planters are at present obliged to breed these animals for the use of their estates. Human beings also, asis familiar to every one, are not exempt from the deleterious influence of change of climate. How many young men who have emigrated to the Indies, or America, have been attacked with disease there, and died—diseases too, which the natives of the place are not liable to take! Such as have survived the effects of tropical maladies, have frequently had their constitutions broken down, or altered in some manner or other. Few return with’ the same health and strength, and ruddy complexions, with which they left home."
"The analogy may be carried still farther; and it may be shown, that, in several instances, both animals and vegetables become so weakened and impaired by their removal from their native countries, or the change of habits, that they lose the faculty of reproducing the species. Few wild animals kept in menageries ever"
"Q  procreate. Birds refuse to breed when confined in cages. The imprisoned eagle will not pair. Plants, likewise, lose their regenerative power, in many cases, by removal from their natural soil, or by the induction of artificial habits. It is a most singular fact, that the sugar cane, though cultivated in every country in the tropics, either in the old or new world, will form seed only in the East Indies, its native place. In the West Indies, in the Brazils, Columbia, Peru, the United States, Mexico, Africa, South of Europe, and in the islands of Polynesia, the canes are as large and vigorous, apparently, as in the east, yet they never bear seed; and in those countries their reproduction is obliged to be continued by cuttings. Wild roses, ranunculuses, and daisies, in our own country, undergo a very great modification by culture; their sexual organs become imperfect, and are converted into petals. Take a wild anemone, and plant it in a rich soil, in a sheltered garden; weed, hoe, and water it well; and, in the course of two or three years the small wild flower will be converted into a magnificent corolla, with perhaps a hundred large brilliant leaves; the stamens and pistils in the centre of the flower: which are the sexual organs, having become changed and expanded into petals in the cultivated plant, being thus deprived of sexual organs, of course can form no seed, and the natural means of reproduction are lost. Allow the same plant to remain in the same ground, permit the weeds to grow around it, disturb not the earth about it, neither manure nor water it, and in the course of a season or two it will resume its original condition: the large, splendid poly-petalous corolla will have diminished into the primitive small flower, with five petals, but it will have regained its sexual organs: it could not continue to be invested with the characters it had received by cultivation, without continuing that cultivation. When exposed to contend with injurious influences, such as hard, poor soil, drought, and growth of weeds for its own preservation it has to assume those hardy qualities, which enable it to live and flourish, in spite of weeds and the nature of the soil; it has, in fact, to become a weed itself."
"Applying this reasoning to the case of the potato, which has, no doubt become impaired in its organization and perhaps, lost a portion of its regenerative power, by cultivation, the remedy appears to us with healthy seed for the future, and thus, getting rid of the disease, is simply to restore the plant to its original wild state; and this may be effected in the following way; at least, such seems to be the simplest and best, under the circumstances."
"Let a field, that is naturally dry, and of a light gravelly soil, and is now in potatoes, be selected ; and having dug three-fourths of the potatoes, allow the rest to remain in the ground in their present condition, with the exception of merely covering such as are exposed, with earth sufficient to protect them from the winter's frost. Let the potatoes lie there untouched; and, in. the spring, disturb not the earth by any agricultural process, but let the plants spring up and grow natu- rally, along with the weeds about them, which, must not be plucked; for they will try the strength of the plants, and choke those which are weak, and would, therefore, be unfit for seed. As an immense number of plants would germinate from the large quantity of seed in the ground; none but the healthiest would live, the weaker ones perishing, being killed be the more vigorous. In the ensuing autumn, the crop would consist of plenty of potatoes, perhaps smaller than usual, but hardier, and possessing those qualities required in healthy seed; for it is a fact, proved by repeated examination, that wherever the potato has grown wild, in lay fields, it has"
"120  invariably been found with sound tubers. I have known farmers who have used a few for seed, and they pronounce them excellent. In the present circumstances they would prove invaluable."
"The only objection to this method is the loss of a little seed, less being required by the present system. This, I grant, would be the case, at the first; but it would be a great gain in the end, as whatever would be procured from next year's crop would be good and wholesome, and prove to be seed that could be depended on."
"Another plan, which would succeed as well, but which would require three years to bring the potatoes to their full growth, is, to sow the seed from the apple. The great length of time, to bring them to perfection, will always be a drawback to its adoption, if a more speedy and equally efficacious plan could he devised, such, I think, I have proposed above. Besides it may happen, that the seed in the seed vessels, haying grown on plants, whose stalks and roots were diseased, may themselves be unhealthy, and unfit for germination, and we have the instance of what took place in St. Helena before us, viz.; that the potato-apples disappeared on the .healthy plants, in proportion to the increase of the rot, and, should the same circumstances occur in this country, we .do not know how soon the time will come, when the remedy I have proposed maybe the 6nly one to which we may be able to have recourse."

"ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY Meeting of the council — Thursday Nov. 6, 1845"
"Farmers Gazette, November 8°"", 1845, page 455"
"The weekly meeting of the council was held this day; the Earl of Clancarty in the chair. There were also present—Wm. Blayney Wade, Gustavus Lambert, Thomas Ball, Win. Jones Armstrong, George A. Hamilton, M.P., Thomas R. Hardy, John Ross Mahon, J. B. Bankhead, Charles Roper, Wm. Smith O'Brien, SI.P, Professor Kane, Thomas Button, Hon. Charles James Trench, William Owen, Acheson Lyle, Pierce J. Blake, Wm. Donnelly, Robert Fowler, and John G. Coddington, Esqrs., Members of the council. Thomas Kirkpatrick, John Sproule, John Owen, Eobert Cassidy and Louis Nolan, €sqrs., Members of the society. Professors Playfair and Lindley, the government commissioners for inquiring into the state of the potato crop, were also present."
"Numerous communications were read by the secretary, in reference to” the disease in the potato crop, which were referred fo the sub-committee for consideration."
"A letter was read from Thomas Joseph Biggs, Esq., of Bandon, in the county of Cork, complaining of the adjudication in butter at the late cattle show at Ballinasloe: that it was most advisable on these occasions to have some professional men associated with the judges; and for this purpose, he would recommend, that at the next show at Limerick, professed butter tasters should be selected from the great market and exporting towns at Waterford and Cork, and associated with the judges, as it was"
"O  impossible otherwise to give satisfaction to the exhibitors, who came a great distance for the purpose. The letter was ordered to be referred to the committee, when making arrangements for the show next year, as the suggestions were most important, and deserved the full consideration of the council."
"A letter was read from Richard More O'Farrell, Esq., M.P., stating that the disease in the potato crop was general in his neighbourhood, with the exception of one field of lumpers and cups, consisting of about three acres, part drained and part not, but the potatoes equally safe in both parts. They were grown on a compost of bog- stuff, earth, well-rotted dung, and a large proportion of ashes, produced from corn gravel. The manure had not fermented; and a portion of it still remains for inspection— and referring same to the consideration of the commissioners."
"A letter was also read from Mr. William Love, steward to Mr. Purcell, of Halverstown, stating that he had great doubts as to the propriety of leaving the potatoes in the ground; as, if heavy rain, or frost, or snow should set in, he feared the greater part would perish. They were then digging and putting them into small pits, only three feet wide, and ten inches deep, under the surface, and brought to a narrow top, and then covered with six inches of earth, leaving a few inches of the potatoes at the top uncovered but secured with potato stalks thus allowing any heat that may arise to escape. He felt, however, at a loss to decide what was best to be done, as the thing was so new and so distressing; and in a subsequent letter he says that he is grieved to state that the symptoms of progressive disease were more apparent in those potatoes that had been dug twelve days since; and that he had, therefore, stopped digging, until he had better proof of their keeping both in and out of the ground."
"All these communications, together with various others on the same subject, were ordered to be referred to the sub-committee, previous to being sent to the government commissioners for their information."
"Mr. George Alexander Hamilton, chairman of the deputation that had waited on Sir Thomas Fremantle, at the Castle, from the council, on last Friday, reported that they had communicated the resolution of the council, in reference to providing employment for the labouring poor of Ireland, during the ensuing spring. That a long conversation then ensued, in which it was stated, on behalf of the deputation, that it was the view of the council, that by facilitating, and, if possible, cheapening the preliminary inquiries, which are required by the general Drainage Act, the 5th and 6ih Viet. chap. 89., previous to that act being brought into operation, a stimulus might be given to a most suitable and profitable source of employment for the labouring poor, in most parts of Ireland—the advantages of which employment, as well as the disposition are fully proved by the last report of the drainage commissioners on the subject. That it was also stated on the part of the deputation, that there was in their opinion a strong feeling that the resources of Ireland should be made available to meet any difficulty which might arise, rather than that alms or gratuitous aid should be sought for. That the provisions of the general drainage act, if brought into more active operation, and the act of last session for the drainage of estates, would prove most useful means for making those resources available in such an emergency as that which the failure of the potato crop might create. That the impediments which appeared to exist in reference to the former act, which to a great extent, is introductory to the second,"
"122  are the delay in the completion of the preliminary surveys, and the heavy expense attending those proceedings, including the amount required for a deposit, previous to such preliminary surveys being made. That this amount being generally as large for inquiries into the proposed drainage of a small, as of a large extent of land, operated to prevent applications under that act, except for very large and extensive drainages."
"The deputation also reported, that Sir Thomas Fremantle undertook to bring the whole subject under the consideration of her Majesty's government, and to make the necessary inquiries respecting the expense and delay of the preliminary proceedings under the general drainage act; and the deputation felt bound to acknowledge, not only the courtesy of the right hon. baronet, but also the anxious desire which he evinced to receive and consider, any proposition or practical suggestions calculated to afford relief in any emergency which might arise."
"The sub-committee appointed to inquire into the best mode of drying and preparing the potato meal or flour, reported that they had examined the different commu- nications on the subject, and were of opinion that those recommended by Colonel Robinson, and published in Sounders of the 29th ultimo, were the most available for the general uses of the population, and most deserving of recommendation by the council."
"They also reported, that as the commissioners state in their second report, that after the extraction of the starch from the diseased potatoes, the pulp may, when dried, be applied with confidence to the nourishment of animals, and that if the starch be mixed up with the dry residual pulp, materials will be produced really representing the original potato, equivalent to it as food, and capable of preservation for any length of time; they suggested that the attention of the council should be directed to the subject, at the same time that they would hesitate to recommend its general adoption without further experience on the subject. :"
"They also feel bound to state certain facts which; have since come to their knowledge, and that, having visited the starch factory of Mr. Cashell, Brabazon- street, for the purpose of ascertaining his system of drying farina, they collected much useful information, in their opinion, acquired by long experience, upon the preservation of the crop, in its original state. The system he recommends is as follows :-—"
"That all potatoes should be dug out immediately, and stored in sheds, where they can, be frequently turned. The sheds should he open at the ends, or formed in such a manner as that there shall be a current of air through the potatoes, which is, the great object. If the bad part of the potato is cut off, the remainder will keep in this way."
"Temporary sheds could easily be erected by the poorer classes at the back of their cottages: a few sticks placed against the wall, and very roughly covered would suit all purposes, should they not have out-houses which they could convert to the purpose."
"The stalks ought not, on any account, to be allowed to come into contact with the"
"Oo  potatoes, as they are diseased and likely to infect them. The earth in which diseased potatoes have been grown, is also infected, and therefore they should be kept as clear of it as possible."
"Pitting the potatoes should, under any circumstance be avoided, as they cannot be kept sufficiently dry, and and because they cannot be turned and examined which it is necessary to do frequently."
"Lime he recommends in all cases, but to be very cautiously used, say in the proportion of two-thirds dry mould or sand, to one of lime. The potatoes, should be taken up in dry weather, and not put in layers more than two feet high, the lime to be well slacked and sifted lightly over them, as they are being stored. Let them remain for two or three days, and then turn them over, which must be repeated every third or fourth day until the disease is dried up, which will take three weeks or a month to do; they may then be stored something heavier, but inspected monthly. ."
"Mr. Gashell recommends that lime should be “used lightly on the fields where the potatoes were grown, before any crop shall be sown in them."" Another mode of making use of the diseased potato has come under the observation of the committee, and which they wished to present to the notice of the council, together with some of the meal obtained by the process adverted to. - It consists of boiling the potatoes, or steaming them, then mashing and drying them in a common oven, griddle, or kiln, -being careful to turn them often, so as to prevent burning, and then grinding or bruising them into meal..A piece of alum in the water, when boiling, is found an improvement: 14 Ibs. of potatoes, so treated, produce 3 Ibs. of meal. The potatoes should be peeled before being boiled,"
"As this process seems to produce a much larger portion of human food than any other yet suggested, we have no hesitation in calling, the particular attention of the council to it."
The above report was ordered to be received.
"The secretary exhibited specimens of the potato-meal above described, prepared by Professor Davy, and furnished by Mr. Classon , and, also a specimen of meal from Mr. Pooler, prepared from potatoes, dred in- the first instance in slices, and afterwards ground and pulverized, both of which excited considerable interest; as they appeared to combine the two objects which the council had in view — of retaining the nutritious qualities of the potato, after expelling the water only."
"The council having also taken into consideration the different reports of the commissioners, fully approved of the recommendations contained in their third or last report; and it was therefore ordered, that the secretary be instructed to write to the different local farming societies, in connection with the central one, directing their attention to that report, and to the recommendations contained therein, and requesting that if they approve of the advice and directions therein given distribute copies of that report throughout their respective districts, for the benefit of the farming classes. - and for this purpose, the. Secretary was directed to communicate with Sir Thomas Fremantle at the castle, and to obtain from him a sufficient number of copies of the above report, in order to transmit it in this manner,"
124  throughout the different districts alluded to.
"The council then proceeded to view the different implements for grinding potatoes into pulp to make flour &c., which had been sent in to compete for the two prizes of ten guineas each; and it being the general opinion of the council that the question could not be settled that day, it was ordered that all the articles should be sent over to the Royal Dublin Society, Kildaredare-street, to be inspected on the following day with the consent of their council, and that the following gentlemen should be appointed judges to award the premiums, viz.:— Professor Kane, Doctor Playfair, Hon.Charles J. Trench, Thomas Hutton, Charles Roper and Robert Mallet, Esqrs. :"
"Mr. Trench and Mr. Lyle were also added to the local committee, which was ordered to meet from day to day, to continue their inquiries, and the council then adjourned until Thursday next."
"THE POTATO—ITS DISEASE AND REMEDY Farmers Gazette, November 8°"", 1845, pages 457-458"
"Sir- My potatoes were, this year, grown in coarse clayey soil, lately drained, and where potatoes had never grown before. The variety chiefly cultivated was that white imported, by Mr. Hannay, Dalquharn, about 1837, and grown on this farm in and since 1840. I have never planted them in soil where potatoes had formerly grown. This variety throws out stringy roots often three feet long, some of its tubers grow a foot or farther distant from, the parent seed; its crop has always been the heaviest on the ground, latterly its quality has almost equalled the "" flat red,"" and up to October, 1844, I never suspected its entire soundness. But the unnatural character of season 1844, especially the extreme heat and drought (followed soon by frost) about the first week; of. September, raised my fears about the safety of winter storing, and led to -the strictest attention in pitting. Our pits kept well till after planting time, when unusual tenderness and softening began to appear. Nothing’ could exceed either the favourable conditions of planting or the luxuriant promise of the crop. Smallish, uncut tubers were planted. The manure was, a small dressing of glue dross wrought in in winter, and farm dung at planting time. ‘Many of the stems exceeded four feet in height; all were strong and healthy. No symptom of disease appeared on them when the country was filled with lamentable reports: no spot appeared to darken their verdure till the night frosts about the 22nd September blackened their leaves. In September part of them were daily raised for the table; and not a spot could, be seen on any tuber. The first notice of small spots, only skin deep, was about 6th October, I carefully raised stems in different parts on the 9th and found so very little of disease that I had still doubts of it. But from that date the increase of disease was so rapid that I found fully half the crop affected by the 16th; when we were raising. Being now further aroused to danger, I devoted every energy to the subject, collected all that I found in agricultural periodicals, carried the discordant ideas to the field, and utterly, without an opinion, determined to try what facts might be drawn from an attentive raising. A large grape lifted the whole, stem with the earth about it: The earth was gently"
"O  removed by the fingers, so as to give, a view of the position of the tubers, sound and unsound, state of root, old seed &c. Many stems different parts were thus deliberately examined, and my observations follow:"
"With few exceptions the stems, above ground are entirety sound, firm when cut across, strong, and unusually woody. A very few weak stems are softened, and in one or two cases, I found them hollow. As the leaves continued green until the the frost blackened them, I have no evidence that the disease began above ground."
". The old seed in most cases is so completely wasted that only the skin remains,"
"and this is covered with small insects. In a few cases I found the seed, having a black skin full of blackish watery pulp matter too offensive in smell to admit of minute inspection. lts smell resembled that of stale cat's dug. In former seasons, at raising, I have generally found the old seed in a hard, firm state, apparently shrunk in bulk, with a rough chopped skin, and only decayed when in wet ground. This year I have, day after day, looked in vain for one specimen of seed with the usual firmness."
"3.The /ower end’ of the main stem resting on the decaying or wasted seed was, in, all cases, in a rotting state, and this decay extended from two to five inches up the stem under ground. The skin of the stem at this part was generally destroyed, and a hoary covering of white mouldiness on the stem extended nearly to the surface of the soil."
". The tubers nearest the old seed are first and chiefly affected, and generally"
"on the side of them next the seed. In the majority of cases, the sprout end appeared most affected; but this had so many exceptions that I could trace no apparent law. Those at the end of /ong stringy rootlets, if not near the rotting seed of the next plant, appeared quite sound; and even those with strings but an inch or two long, were ""sound"" when the string came from a part of the under-ground stem higher than the decay had reached."
"- Where the string of a tuber was several inches long, the part of it next the"
"stem was decayed; while the part, next the tuber appeared fresh and healthy. But where the string was only one or two inches long, and near the root seed, it was wholly decayed, and the tuber dropped from it as soon as it was touched in the soil; on the contrary, when, four or more inches above the rotting seeds both the short string and tuber seemed quite sound. If I had wanted this variety, I could not have obtained the above decisive evidence of the beginning and spread of the disease; for as all in other varieties have the tubers growing almost close to the stem, and as their stems were much weaker and more apt to be affected by frost,: they did not afford evidence which at once could have been depended on; though, as far as it went, it seemed to support the evidence, drawn from the first variety; Two-thirds or three fourths of the flat reds were plainly diseased to the heart, as appeared, by cutting many of them. As far as I could find the small round red- was entirely sound, though in the same drills with, flat Reds. - A very few of the old blues, I would say about 5 per cent, and these chiefly the smaller tubers, were diseased near the skin; while, on the contrary, the affected of the flat reds were chiefly the /arger tubers. The stems of most of the coloured varieties were hollow-, and often black internally; yet some of the stronger stems, even of the flat reds, were sound and compact. Almost all the stems had begun to decay at the under-ground extremity, and were more or less covered with"
"126  white mould. The seed of the flat reds was almost wholly wasted, that of the old blues had begun to waste, but yet retained much firmness; its decay had begun near the skin and its interior portion seemed little altered."
"The above observations leave no doubt on my mind that the disease began by the putrefaction of the seed, and thence gradually affected the nearest tubers, ascended the under-ground part of the stem, and was from it conveyed along the stringy roots to the more distant tubers."
"The microscope was repeatedly used, but as the one in my possession magnifies only to between 800 and 700 and as the dark cloudy weather was unfavourable to its use, I could obtain from no facts of decisive character."
"Moren and Berkley have connected the disease with the attacks of a mould fungus; and, what is of more decisive importance, Dr. Rayer discovered a mould fungus in the intercellular passages of potatoes immediately after germination."
Might the sporulae (or seeds) of these fungi have been concealed in the potato
"before germination, and merely brought into a more advanced stage by the ©"
"decay consequent on the germination ? They Might enter with the sap which nourished the potato during the former season, if this be the fact, it is hopeless to expect sound potatoes, unless we could destroy the Fungic sporulae; for while they live in the seed, they first find decaying matter, and while they feed on it, promote further decay, and multiply their species."
"The fungi which injure our industrial crops are known by naturalists, to be minute plants which proceed, from and reproduce their kind by very minute seeds called sporulae. These seeds are said to be every where dispersed in the atmosphere, capable of being absorbed by the roots and pores of the stem and leaves of plants and ready to germinate whenever their find a dead or living subject m a condition suited to their growth. All of them grow on organized matter; none derive nourishment directly from the soil, air, or water. Many of thesee are so minute as to require the highest powers of the microscope for their detection. Their reproductive powers are quite beyond comprehension (Henstow). Like animals they absorb oxygen and exhale carbonic acid gas (Marcet); Moisture and confined or still air"
are indispensable to their growth.
"But different kinds of fungi require different conditions for their development; some grow only in slightly acid menia, while others are developed only in slightly alkaline matter. Dutrochet mixed a little albumen in distilled water, and set it aside for a year. No, fungi appeared; yet he found that in eight days after he had added a minute portion of sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, muriatic, or acetic acid to this, fungi of the class Monilia appeared in it. He add a trace of ‘alkali to another portion, and in the same time found fungi of the class Botrytis in It."
"This experiment suggests an important fact on the subject of manures. It shows us that where albuminous matter is either in the soil or manure, dilute acids may give rise to fungi destructive either to the intended crop or that which arises from the seed. And as bones contain albuminous, or gelatinous materials, it seems to show the impropriety of using bones dissolved in sulphuric acid; for if the season be"
"oO  damp and cloudy, numberless fungic sporulae may enter the plants (turnips), and thus either the present crop or (if it has grown for seed) the crop arising from its seed may, in a wet season, be destroyed by fungi. Part of the disease of turnips now complained of in Ireland, may be traceable to seed thus grown; and the matter is so important that it is to be hoped no pains will be spared either to verify or confute it. But Dutrochet's expenroent suggests another deeply important inquiry. We have, of late, sought to increase our crops by increased doses of atomised manure. Animal decay evolves water, carbonic acid, and ammonia. May the ammonia evolved from an excessive dose of animal manure, in a wet cloudy season, become the medium by which destrnctive fungi may be evolved."
"The potato fungus requires much further examination. Does it grow in an acid or alkalescent medium ? Is it found in other plants (as- the wheat fungi, and even ergot, are found in our indigenous grasses)? May it also be the fact that the extended practice of forcing potatoes by excess of atomized manures has multiplied the potato fungus to an extent which threatens its extermination."
"Till these inquiries are disposed of, it is impossible to propose any remedy with full confidence of success; yet, as it is obviously our duty to ‘follow’ the course which our present knowledge points out as the most probable, I shall now briefly state what the above facts and most others, seem to indicate as a"
REMEDY
"We can infect sound wheat by rubbing the seed with the matter of smut; and we can kill the sporulae of the smut and bunt fungi by suitable steeps for the wheat seed. It yet remains to be proved whether we can kill the sporulae of the potato fungus in its intercellular passages by any steep which will not also destroy the potato embryo. Only we know that if we can prevent decay in the tubers which now appear sound, we thus prevent the further development or progress of the fungus. Hence, if we could preserve our ""sound"" tubers till spring in their present condition, we might, by means which will be suggested before then, have a fair prospect of a moderate crop."
"Lime-water has, for many years, been proved, by Sir Charles Menteath, of Closeburn, an effectual preventative of dry-rot in timber. This, perhaps, renders the albuminous matter in the wood unfit for yielding food to the fungi; we have no reason to suppose that it kills the sporulae already in the wood (if any there exist) though it prevents their further development."
"Again, lime-water has long been employed for preserving eggs. The matter in eggs which is chiefly disposed to decay is their albumen. If lime can preserve eggs, we have strong reason to. suppose that the judicious management will also preserve, potatoes till next spring."
"The lime should be such as will slake into fine bulky powder. If thoroughly mixed by sifting, after it is dry and cold, with about one-twentieth of its weight of dry chloride of lime (or half-a-pound of the chloride to each imperial bushel .of the fine slaked powder), this may greatly improve it; as the excess of lime will take up the chlorine gas, and cause it to be but very, slowly evolved. The best chloride of lime"
"128  may be had in Glasgow for 28s. to 30s. per cwt. Hence the expense is very trifling. No one acquainted with the subject will recommend a solution of the chloride. To do any good in a potato pit, it must be used dry. Salt ought not to be used. If! had not so far exceeded due limit, I would have stated reasons for this. But as in the, damp of many pits, an excess even of dry chloride .of lime may"
"‘destroy vitality, it should not be attempted -but where the farmer is in a condition to _"
manage it with proper care. We have good reason to expect that the dry powder of slaked lime will alone answer the end.
It is of the very highest importance that the potato pit be kept as near as possible at
the same teaiperature day and night throughout the winter. This temperature
"should ‘be low, but not at freezing; 45 deg to 47 deg Fahr is what I have found quite manageable by excluding the winter sun and covering the moulds’ with a, little litter, about January 1. I always lay my potatoes against a wall facing the north make the pile 8- feet wide and not more than 4 feet high. They have a covering of earth about 6 inches thick. Instead of using air-chimneys my object is ""totally to exclude air; and hence a crack is no sooner observed than it is plastered up. I appeal to hundreds who have bought seed from me during the past seven or eight years. They can attest its sure growing character. The floor of the pit must be kept dry, and rain must be excluded from entering above."
"The potatoes should be put alongside the ground intended for storing them. Remove all that appear in the least damaged or cut; sprinkle a little dry lime powder over the floor; bring forward the potatoes gently in buckets; spread six inches depth of potatoes over the limed floor; sift a good powdering of lime—say a quarter of an inch thick over this layer: add another layer of potatoes, cover again with lime, and thus go on till the top is reached; sift a little over the top and cover immediately with earth, and begin a new portion of the pit. Thus the whole may be put into a very promising state for winter keep, if it can be done in dry weather. One imperial bushel of the lime- powder may suffice for 8 or 10 cwt. of potatoes. Where I intend to keep seed, I never, on any account, open a pit till seed time. I think the risk from admitting air, is greater than any I can otherwise suffer."
"The fact that the disease of this crop began with the putrefaction of its seed, seems to point out a method or avoiding this next spring: if we prepare a portion of good, but not too rich soil, early in spring, dibble smallish uncut tubers 4 to 5 indies deep, and about the same distance asunder every way, in this soil; prepare the potato drills as usual in April or May; when the young plants come a few inches above ground raise them carefully, remove the seed without injuring the roots, and plant in the drills either by dibbling in or slightly splitting up the drills, laying the p;ants 8 or 10 inches apart and covering them. The soil should now be either moist or watered. No practical man would propose this but as a /ast resort. The trouble will make the potatoes necessarily dear. But as we have strong reason to fear that, with an ordinary season, the seed will rot in the soil before the plants are far advanced and thus may annihilate the crop; and, as we cannot expect a supply of new seed from South America by planting time, it may be better to try this than to incur any other risk.—Yours, &c."

"With regard to the potato disease that now engrosses much of public aitention, I find, by experience that air, light, and dryness are the best remedy."
"I had commenced converting my diseased potatoes into flour, but find that they have so much improved, by exposure, during the late fine weather, that for the present I have discontinued the manufacture."
"Along the length of my potato pits I have air channels made underneath, of timber, and along through the course of the pits, other channels of dry turf- sods; my housed potatoes I have on a floor of turf, laid sufficiently close to prevent the potatoes from falling to the ground, and leaving the doors daily open. If sufficient exertion be used in preserving the crop, I trust there is no danger of famine; but I lament to inform you, that in this district, at least, there is not any suffient exertion or precaution used, individual advice is rather disregarded. I think there should be a call on public bodies, in every place, to give attention to this subject, and convey to the approved remedies, and induce them to apply them."

THE POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, November 8'"", 1845, page 458"
"SIR — Being much interested about the melancholy state of the potato crop, I think every person ought seriously consider what mode to adopt to insure, if possible, a crop for next year, I therefore wish for your opinion upon the trial I am inclined to make immediately, as now I can select sound seed; and it is impossible to say if that will be the case next March. I have ready the spot of ground (one and a-half acres) on which my late crop of potatoes grew, and finer could not be seen, but, I am sorry to say, they are gradually decaying, though every care is taken to give them as much air as possible. What I think of doing is, to harrow in about 60 or 70 barrels of lime, or 5 cwt. of guano; open the drills; plant whole potatoes, 12 inches apart; ridge them up well and high, to preserve them against frost and rain, and let them remain so until the end of March; then examine them, and if found growing well all will be right; if on the contrary, they fail. A crop of barley can be sown and in the meantime, I can have another spot of ground ready for the potatoes, provided sound seed can be had. I have twice planted potatoes in November, and found it answer well - no failure in them. Some may say it may be wrong to plant them in the ground from whence they have just been taken, as it may be infected. I say that is folly; as in that case every potato field in the united kingdom must have been so,"
"130  the disease having visited all more or less. Many learned persons have given various opinions as to the cause of this rot they are working in the dark and in my humble opinion, the natm ostural is, a general atmospheric visitation occurred at the time of the tubers coming to maturity. I have gone through many parts of my neighbourhood, and examined the potato digging; universally I found the common white (the poor man's crop) much the safest. Exposure to air, in dry weather, as much as possible, certainly checks the progress of the rot, dries it, and renders, the sound part good."
"Baking or roasting in hot ashes is decidedly the best mode of cooking them, the unsound parts being first cut off, which can be quickly done by a girl."
"I should say I have no fear in using guano, as a part of my last crop manured solely with it was the test, and more free from the disease than the part highly manured with good rotten dung. I fear I have trespassed on your time with this long letter, but as it is in a good, cause, I hope yon will excuse an old subscriber to your valuable ""GAZETTE.—"
"Yours, &c., A. Riall, Westgrove, Clonmel, November 4, 1845."
"[In last GA.ZETTE we recommended the planting of potatoes just now as a likely means of securing the future crop. Our correspondent, intending to plant them in the field from which they were raised, should apply lime as above, for the purpose of destroying the seeds of fungi with which it may be infested. The general opinion !s, that the disease has been communicated by some sadden atmospherical change; but it may, nevertheless, Jeave the gronud in an infected state, which it wll be well to guard against.]"
"SHOULD POTATO PITS BE VENTILATED Farmers Gazette, November 8"", 1845, page 458"
"sIR_ like ill to argue on a subject where I may be wrong; but hear me a little. During the past nine years, when potato failures were extensive around, I never had one blank. Year after year, I offered a sovereign for every seed which could be found to have failed in my fields. Search was often made, but one was never found. Till the last two years, when failures had become less frequent, and people dared to trust their own seed, I sold nearly all my potatoes for seed every spring. They were often carted ten to fifteen miles distance, and, with the exception of one man, who cut and roasted them for several days in the sun, I never heard ofa single failure, or even a blank wherever they were planted."
"If my method of pitting had been improper, could I have had this success ? Yet I never ventilated my pits, but did my utmost to exclude every breath of air from them. Their covering of clayey earth, was six to eight inches thick, well beat down, and often examined, to fill a crack as soon as it appeared. I never changed my seed, but to this day have what I bought in spring, 4837. By excluding air, I kept my potatoes from germinating till the pits were opened about the 20th of April. On"
"O  first opening a pit, not a sprout could be seen; yet, strange as it may appear, the pit had been opened but a few hours, (and only at one end) when sprouting was manifest, and I could not again stop it by closing the pit."
"I suppose that while the pit was kept close, the potatoes were surrounded by a confined atmosphere of carbonic acid gas which prevented sprouting, and when the pit was opened this gas flowed out, oxygen was admitted, and hence growth proceeded rapidly. Look at a malt-barn, and you will find that ventilation is em- ployed to promote germination. Sow seeds or plant potatoes several inches deep, press or beat the earth over the seed to exclude air, and you find that germination does not take place. Where seeds of rape had been too deeply covered in a clay soil, I have seen them spring up seven years after, when the soil was next fallowed. So ventilate a potato pit, and if the weather, in winter, is mild, air will be admitted to begin germination. We often see this with potatoes kept in houses, and exposed to free air—cold weather follows—growth is stopped in the pit, and thus, by alternation of colds and heats, the potato is weakened, and, perhaps, diseased before the ordinary planting season."
"From the first I have laboured to keep the potato, during winter and early spring, as near as in a pit it can be, at 47° Fahrenheit, the mean temperature of the subsoil, and in the conditions which preserve seed by preventing germination. My practice was dictated by studying the conditions which favour, and those which prevent germination; and my success seems to justify my practice."
"The ""mummy wheat"" shows us that if air and moisture can be excluded, seeds may be preserved alive for thousands of years; and, on the contrary, the difficulty of so excluding air, as to prevent germination in hot climates, is clearly shown by the extreme difficulty of bringing many seeds alive from India. The closest corking in bottles is not sufficient, without also burying the bottles deeply in salt-water."
"I would not have troubled yon with this, had I not felt convinced that ventilating the pits will destroy the prospect of seed for next spring. How, in ordinary hands, can damp air, or even rain be kept from entering pits by the air-chimneys, during the period of wet and stormy weather ?"
"Since I wrote my paper on the ""Disease and Remedy of the Potato"" I have had my ” sound"" potatoes moved, examined, and replaced on the pit floor, as there directed, with slaked lime. A few diseased ones had escaped notice, when selected in the field, but I don’t think that these had injured the rest, as all were put up pretty dry. I find, on trial, that 1 imperial bushel of slaked lime powder is sufficient to cover the floor, and give a thorough powdering of a ton of potatoes. On every single layer of potatoes, I sieve a white covering of lime, and in the same way mixed lime with the earth which covered them. Thus I have either killed or expelled all the worms and insects about them. The lime will destroy any hurtful matter on their skin, and form a crust which, in the absence of free air, will, I expect, preserve them till spring. In a former article I stated to you the antiseptic quality of lime when air is excluded. If I am mistaken, I conscientiously affirm that / do not wish to mislead anyone."

"CAMBRIDGE, SATURDAY, Nov. 1—The Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire has thought it his duty to issue an address to the labourers of the county and isle upon the subject of the potato disease. It is as follows:- ""Fellow Countrymen—A sense of duty induces me to address you on the subject of the potato. It is not necessary on this occasion to state the nature or the cause of the decay of that most important article of food, I wish to induce you to look forward to the consequence of neglecting the endeavour to stop the progress of the evil. If you do neglect to do so, all will be - lost. From all I can learn, moisture is the food on which the decay increases, and dryness the medicine to be used for the cure. Therefore, do not pit the potatoes in the usual way; but, after most carefully picking them, and separating the bad from the good, place the good under a roof (if you have space) placed in layers, and not more than four potatoes deep, so that they may keep effectually dry. Where you have not house room expose them to the sun and air during dry weather, on the surface of the ground, and then pile them in small conical heaps on the surface, thatching them over with straw, .and cutting a deep trench round about them with a good drain from the trench to carry off the water. Pick the best potatoes for seed next year, and take them into the cottage, keeping them quite dry, and let no price induce you to part with them; for the ext year seed will not be procurable. I also advise yjat at present you do not sell, for I feel sure that at no distant perios,"
"OQ  the price of the potato will be unprecedented. I further advise all who have pitted potatoes at once to open the pits, and pick the potatoes over again. I am, fellow countrymen, ever your faithful servant."

"FURTHER REPORTS OF THE COMMISSIONERS To his Excellency, Barron Haytesbury, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland etc. Farmers Gazette, November 8"", 1845, pages 470-471"
"MY LORDSHIP - Haying laid before your Excellency our - views as to the best means of storing the potato, and converting to useful purposes such as are too much diseased to offer a probability of being preserved, we now have the honour to bring under your consideration the question of seed for a future year. If, in our former reports, we have found it difficult to determine what course, under the peculiar circumstances of Ireland, it might, be most advisable to pursue, we are still more embarrassed, on the present occasion, in consequence of the conflicting testimony that has been presented to us, and the absence of all decisive evidence as to the cause of the potato disease. The want of experience, derived from previous visitations of the same nature, also renders it impossible to affirm in what manner the potato may be affected in the course of the nest few months."
"We have, however, endeavoured to ascertain all that is positively known upon these subjects, by the examination of a great variety of published’. Documents both foreign and domestic; by personal observation, and by inquiries addressed to persons of practical experience or scientific reputation."
"It is a very general opinion, and one entertained by men whose extensive knowledge entities it to respect, that parasitical fungi, similar in their nature to those which produce mildew and dry rot, are the real cause of the malady. It is stated that one of these plants belonging to the genus ""Botrytis,"" and similar to that, which some years since produced great mischief among the silk- worms of France and Italy, has attacked the potato crop. It is described as entering the potato plant by the breathing pores of its leaves, and then pissing down through the interior of the stem into the tubers, in which its mycelium, or spawn, fixes itself, traversing the cellular mass, separating the cells themselves, causing alteration in their chemical condition, and thus producing decay. In other cases where the spawn is not apparently distinguishable in diseased portions of potatoes, even by the most practiced observers, it is suggested that the juices of the plant may be visited by the parasite which destroyed the leaves, and that particles of it, too obscure to be distinguished by the naked eye, unless it makes its appearance on the outside of the potato in the form of mouldy tufts; but its spawn may be detected in the diseased portions by the microscope, whether any external indications of its presence can be perceived or not; hence it is inferred that it is produced exclusively from within. It is, however, within our knowledge, that when apparently sound potatoes are pitted in places where the mouldiness of a diseased potato is able to appear, that mouldiness rapidly establishes itself on the sound potatoes at every point where their surface has been wounded or bruised;"
"134  and that, under such circumstances, the disease is immediately extended through the entire mass."
"That the spawn of fungi is present in large quantity in diseased potatoes is undoubted, the evidence of the best microscopical observers would be with us - conclusive on that point, even if we had not verified the fact by personal examination. We also regard it as well ascertained, that these parasites spread rapidly in warm and damp situations, producing infinite mischief under such circumstances, and that their advance is only to be successfully resisted by dryness. But it does not appear to us that their being the original cause of the disease has been well established; if it were so, it is difficult to conceive why fields of potatoes’ placed very near each other should be differently affected, or why certain varieties of this plant should be much less injured than others-—the Irish apple potato, for instance, which appears to have suffered more extensively than any other. We are also unable to reconcile with the theory of the potato disease being caused by parasitical fungi, the remarkable fact that in its present form it is certainly of modern origin. That it may have always existed is possible, though of this we have no proof; but at least there can be no doubt that it has only manifested itself to any considerable degree within the last few years. We cannot suppose the botrytis which observers find to be the kind of fungus that"
"attack the potato, to be a recent creation. We must assume it to have been co-"""
"existent with the potato itseif; and. therefore, we must conclude that some recent causes have come into operation favourable to its increase, to the present alarming degree. ."
"Without pretending to decide what the cause really was, we may state that it seems to be connected with the cold, cloudy, ungenia! weather, which has characterised the present year, over the north of Europe; conditions highly unsuited to the constitution of a plant which, like the potato, is a native of a warm, dry, sunny country, and insufficient for the ripening of the tubers. Without adverting to solitary cases, which require to be examined with more care than we have the means of giving to them, we may state that amidst the mass of conflicting evidence which we have obtained, the following facts appear to be established:—"
4st—That potatoes planted early in the season are more healthy than ‘those planted later.
"2nd—That the crop has suffered less in dry, elevated, sandy districts, when the influence of the season was mitigated by slowness of growth, or compensated for by the natural warmth of the soil."
3rd—That the late varieties of potatoes are more diseased than early ones.
"4th—That the present disease seems to be confined to the northern parts of Europe and North America, and to be unknown in the countries to the southward."
"If we are right in the conclusion at which we have thus arrived, there will not be cause for serious alarm as to the crop of another year, unless an equally unfavourable season should be experienced, or the supply of healthy seed should be insufficient, or that the parasite should be found to have so entirely taken possession of this year's plants as to overcome the natural power of living bodies to repel the attacks of such enemies to healthy vegetation."
"O  To Providence we must turn in the hope-that a second season like this may not be visited upon us. Should the Almighty, in his infinite mercy, avert such a misfortune, we entertain confident hopes that the two other sources of danger may be guarded against by human foresight and diligence."
"In providing seed for a future year we may look with confidence to such potatoes of home growth as shall have resisted all tendency to decay during the, winter; and we trust that a considerable quantity of them will be found remaining where the precautions for storing which we have recommended shall have been observed. We do not anticipate any danger in the use of them if they are planted early, especially if before being planted they are exposed to tight till they become green. Another source of supply may doubtless be found in the southern parts of Europe, where, we have reason to believe, that disease has not shown itself; and we would strongly advise the public to lose no time in securing what may be procurable from that quarter."
"It is stated by M. Speinge, secretary to the commission appointed in the department of the Rhone, in a report frist published by him on the potato disease,, that it is unknown at Genoa and in the warmer, countries; our own advices describe the crops about Marseilles as being perfectly healthy, and therefore we may conclude that mercantile enterprise will make up by importations a large part of the deficiency to be apprehended."
"lt has also been ascertained by actual experiments that potatoes, although diseased, will grow and produce apparently healthy plants. The Rev. Mr. Berkley, a gentleman eminent above all other naturalists of the United Kingdom, in his knowledge of the habits of fungi, and whom we have consulted on this occasion, states, that although there would certainly be some risk of raising a diseased progeny from a diseased stock, yet the growth of fungi so evidently depends on atmospheric conditions, that it does not follow that because germs are present they should be developed."
"We cannot, however, recommend the use of diseased tubers for seed, except by way of experiment, or in cases of absolute necessity, and it will always be prudent to dust them with powdered lime before they are used. It would indeed be proper to do so even when sets, however sound in appearance, are employed; for this process will destroy the minute seeds of parasitical fungi, which may be sticking to the sets, and assist in repelling these which are lying in the ground. Of course those potatoes being selected which, on careful inspection, show no sign of disease, and hence afford the fairest prospect of a sound and healthy growth."
"Where home-grown sets are to be employed for another crop, we would suggest with very great confidence the adoption of the system of autumn planting; a method of cultivation which has proved advantageous in regard to the crop, which is attended with no unusual expense, and which seems particularly adapted to the circum- stances of the present case. It has been shown by Mr. Grey, of Dilston, that, in Northumberland, his potato crop has been considerably increased in quantity by this practice, and that he has no disease in it this year. In 1844, his autumn-planted crop, produced 100 and 111 loads, when the same quantity of spring planted land yielded but 80 loads under the same circumstances. And in the present season, this gentleman states that his autumn-planted is one-third better than his spring-"
"136  planted crop. There can, therefore, be no doubt that autumn planting may be safely practiced. On this occasion it has these peculiar advantages, that it offers"
"an additional chance of security against renewed attacks from parasitical fungi. On this point, the evidence of Mr. Brokeley is positive. ""Autumn planting,"" he states, "" seems to me to offer the best chance of obtaining healthy sets. What are now planted will produce their tubers before the atmospheric conditions requisite for the growth of the parasite in the leaves can be realized, and without such growth the particles, if present, will be too few to cause much evil. I think, under existing circumstances, the commissioners cannot do a greater service than by encouraging and enforcing as much as possible autumn-planting.” Concurring, as we entirely do, in this recommendation, we trust that the planters of potatoes who have it in their power to adopt it will do so at once."
"All that we conceive it necessary to state, with reference to this practice is, that it"
"should be performed at any time before the end of January; that the sets should be thoroughly dried by exposure to light and air, that they should also be well dusted with lime; and that they should be planted in drills six inches deep, with farm-yard manure below the sets. We also recommend that where the potatoes are not large, they should be planted whole, and even large potatoes should be cut into not more than two pieces."
"We have ascertained that autumn planting has already been practiced throughout Fingal, for the early supply of the Dublin market; and that although the practice has been nearly discontinued, that has not happened for any reason that affects the present question. Neither do we learn that the early period at which the leaves appear above the ground, in spring, is attended with any greater risk than what attends precarious crops like the potato in any season. The effect to be anticipated from autumn planting consists not merely in a probable increase of quantity in next year's supply, but in the saving of potatoes which may perish before spring, if the slow growth which goes on during winter is arrested, and in the early ripening of next year's crop in the event of a second unfavourable season supervening. We may add, that experience has shown, the small refuse potatoes of the year to be suited to autumn planting, if sound, and prepared in the manner we have recommended,"
"It has been supposed by many persons that the potato has arrived at a state of general debility, and that the crop will continue liable to disease like the present, until new varieties shall have been raised from seed. We do not find any satisfactory evidence to support this opinion. It is, doubtless, true that great constitutional differences exist among the varieties of the potato, and that some are much more delicate than others; but we do not find that the oldest varieties are the most tender, or the newest the most hardy. On the contrary, it is within our own knowledge that in the present season very healthy varieties, recently raised, have suffered much more than kinds that have long been in cultivation."
"While, however, we withhold our assent to the proposition that newly raised varieties of the potato are exempt in any peculiar degree from the attacks of disease, we fully admit the fact that some varieties are much more sbject to it than others; and we, therefore, recommend the cultivation of the tender kinds to be discontinued, and that those alone be used for future cropping which experience of the present year"
"O  shows to be best suited to unfavourable seasons; and on this point we may further remark, that all concurrent testimony points out the Irish "" cup"" variety as that which here suffered least from the attacks of the disease. :"
"_ We are also of opinion that it will be imprudent to plant potatoes for the next crop in land which has been just cleared of them. The latter is, in all probability, filled with the seeds of fungi, countless myriads of which must have been scattered over the tainted field; and, although they probably have been borne by the winds to every portion of the country; yet it may be conceived that the soil will be more impregnated - where diseased potatoes have just been growing, than in fields in which decaying maiter was no; actually present."
"Under these circumstances, we are decidedly of opinion that, prior to putting any kind of crop for the coming year into land that has been this season under potatoes, it will be prudent, if not absolutely necessary, that the ground should be turned up and exposed to the action of the atmosphere with care, and that it should be thoroughly manured with lime. We have already recommended that the potatoes, whether whole or cuttings, used for seed, should be dusted over with lime previous to planting; and we further urge that in the case of corn or seed crops of every kind, the seeds should be steeped in lime water, or in the solution of blue stone and salt, well known to farmers. Evidence has already been laid before us of injurious effects, where precautions such as we have described have been neglected."
We forbear from adverting to the possibility of replenishing the diminished supply of potatoes by sowing the seeds formed by the flower. This is an operation which can only be carried on successfully in a garden— is unsuited to the means of the small cultivator— cannot in any way affect the question of immediate supply—and may be safely left to the intelligence of the gardeners scattered through the country.
"Hitherto we have laid before your Excellency, for the purposes of publication, several reports, in a merely popular form, suited to the present emergency. We are confident that the recommendations contained in them, if carried into effect, will tend to mitigate the evils arising from the attacks of the disease in the potato crop. We now propose to proceed forthwith to apply ourselves to the investigation of the important scientific questions involved in the subject; and to report, in due time, the results of our inquiries, in order that from past experience we may derive knowledge for future guidance. These investigations will occupy us for a considerable time, and while we do not contemplate the necessity of publishing further popular directions, we shall hold ourselves in readiness to give our immediate attention to any question which your Excellency may submit for our consideration, or to report from time to time for your Excellency's private information."

"My LORD — We take occasion to mention to your Excellency some facts regarding the action of peat or turf upon diseased potatoes, which we are anxious to make known without delay, although at the present moment we do not wish to put forward a formal report, or official recommendation."
"We had early fixed our attention on the preservative action of turf, and in our first report gave some directions for its use, since which time we have received accounts of its decisive utility in many cases. We had also obtained very distinct evidence that in wet bog land the disease was in reality milder and less extensive than in dryer and more fertile soils. Upon these grounds we proceeded to institute experiments on the action of bog water on diseased potatoes; and we find that certainly, when immersed therein, the disease appears to be arrested, and the substance of the potato does not appear in any way to suffer."
"Our trials having been made in Dublin, and but on a small scale, and also the pressure of circumstances forcing us to make known every plan likely to prove useful without loss of time, we do not wish to have this notice considered as decisively stating that steeping in bog water will stop the progress of the disease; but we consider it highly important that the plan should be tried by persons residing in bog districts, where circumstances render a possible failure in a certain quantity an object of no importance. We have accordingly applied to several gentlemen to institute trials on a large scale, and shall, when we learn the results, at once proceed to lay them before your Excellency."

"The following copy of the communication of Lord Cloncurry, addressed to the Right Hon. Sir Robert Peel, on behalf of the Mansion House Committee:—"
"sIR—As chairman of a committee, consisting of highly respectable gentlemen of all classes of political and religious opinions, appointed at a recent public meeting of the citizens of Dublin, the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor in the chair, it devolves upon me as a public duty, to address you, as responsible adviser of our most gracious Sovereign, and which I do with unfeigned respect, and in the most anxious manner, to call for your fullest and most immediate consideration to the present afflicting and most dangerous state of the people of Ireland. We can assure you that our information is both accurate and extensive—that it reaches over all parts of Ireland and is derived from sources ‘altogether unaffected by any political party motive whatsoever. Be assured, sir, we tell you but the simple truth when we"
"oO  inform you that the danger of famine is immediate and pressing, and if not averted by the activity of man, and the blessing of a merciful providence, must result in a pestilence of the most frightful nature."
"We do solemnly assure you, of our perfect knowledge, that the destruction of the potato crop is extremely extensive, with some slight mitigation in particular loca- lities; but, as a general calamity, is extending to all the provinces and counties of Ireland. Nor does the evil rest here—for day after day the disease is extending. Quantities of potatoes, apparently in the most healthy state one day, are found, on the ensuing, partially, if not entirely, unfit for human or even animal food; the disease is in its nature expansive, and is, to our knowledge, daily and hourly expanding; nor is there any rational evidence to show that this wide-spreading rottenness will find any other limit than in the destruction of the entire potato crop. We do not intend you any disrespect—quite the contrary; but we do wish to im- press upon your mind the awful responsibility which, as her Majesty's principal adviser, you incur if your government hesitates to adopt the most speedy and extensive possible means of alleviating the impending calamity. Whilst you hesitate—if hesitate you shall—the people of Ireland are about to perish in countless numbers. May we respectfully refer you to Lord Devon's report of last session, where you will find, or indeed, whence we take for granted you are already informed that the Irish agricultural labourers and their families are calculated to amount to more than four millions of human beings, whose only food is the potatoes—whose only drink is water—whose houses are pervious to the rain—to whom a bed or blanket is a luxury almost unknown—and who are more wretched than any other people in Europe. We respectfully call your attention to the fact that the foregoing description of the state of the Irish peasantry was published long before there was or could be the least suspicion of the most afflicting visitation of Providence, in the destruction of the present crop. If, then, such was the condition of a large portion of the Irish people, even in favourable harvests, you will, in your humanity, easily judge what must be the horrors of their situation, if the approaching famine be allowed to envelope the entire population."
"We implore of you, sir, not to allow yourselves to be persuaded that we exaggerate the horrors or certainty of the approaching famine; we have no motive under heaven of misleading or misinforming you, and even if we had, you may believe we are utterly incapable of acting on such a motive; our only object is to impress on your mind what we know to be the fact, that famine and pestilence are at our door, and can be averted only by the most extensive and active precautions. The season for receiving supplies of foreign food is rapidly terminating; the northern ports of Europe, as also the ports of the British American colonies, as well as of the Northern American States will soon be closed, until it will be too late to receive supplies from these countries— other foreign countries afflicted by a similar calamity have already been before us in the market, and are daily enhancing the price of those supplies, which our government might otherwise calculate on; the lives of the people of Ireland are in the hands of the government. If you determine not to take immediate precautions, we are unable to contemplate the extent of the horrible consequences resulting from the destruction of the people's food, and from the neglect of the protection of government. We are incapable of using any language that could be construed into dictation; but we respectfully declare it to be our conviction that it is the imperative duty of the government"

4st The opening the ports of Ireland for all kinds of
"human food, free of duty."
"2nd-The closing the ports of Ireland against the exportation of oats, either ground or whole. :"
"3rd—That the consumption of oats by cavalry regiments in Ireland be diminished as much as it possibly can with safety to the public service. . 4th—That the distillation from grain be suspended in Ireland, due precaution being taken to prevent illicit distillation."
"5th—That there be immediately raised money, by way of loan, to the extent of one million and a half, at the least, and chargeable upon Irish resources — such as the department of Woods and Forests, &c., and that the amount of such loan be applied in the first instance to the increasing the quantity, and decreasing the price of food in Ireland."
"6th—That we earnestly recommend the formation granaries in each of the poor law unions, and other localities throughout Ireland, so as to bring food within the reach of all its inhabitants. ;"
"7ih—That we earnestly recommend the setting the people to work without any delay, by urging on and assisting the construction of railways, and also in works of drainage, as recommended by government commissioners, and other works of general or local utility, - I have the honour to be Sir, your obedient servant,"

"EDITORIAL — FARMERS GAZETTE Farmers Gazette, November 15'"", 1845, pages 472-473"
We have hitherto refrained from making any comments on the reports of the commissioners appointed to enquire into the circumstances connected with the
"disease of the potato crop for the purpose of suggesting modes by which the mode by which the evil can be mitigated. We are forced to confess that we have been disappointed with these reports: and there is good reason to fear that this feeling is participated in throughout the country; yet, while saying this, we admit, most readily, the .difficulties the commissioners had to contend with in dealing with a case almost unprecedented in the history of the vegetable kingdom. One great and serious error was committed by government, in the first place, viz.: appointing mere scientific men to investigate the matter; for, however well qualified they might be to"
"142  inquire into the botanical and chemical nature of the question, neither possessed that practical knowledge respecting the usual modes of storing potatoes, which would have been so useful in guiding them to the discovery of others adapted to the peculiar exigencies of the case; indeed so far as giving directions for the treatment of diseased potatoes was concerned, either for food or seed, the best of their recom- mendations have been but the echo of what might have been seen in the GAZETTE, and other publications, weeks before. Had a practical farmer, or two, been associated along with the learned professors in their inquiry, several errors, arising from lack of practical knowledge, would have been avoided; and the confidence of the farmers generally, regarding the success of the modes proposed more effectually secured. We do not deem it necessary to enter into any detailed expose of the errors committed by the commissioners, in their various reports, neither would it serve any good purpose to do so now, as we are assured the good sense of our readers has prevented them from blindly following the merely theoretical part of the suggestions contained in these documents. While feeling it our duty to remark on these reports, we would endeavour to do so ina spirit of perfect candour, and to avoid that bitterness of invective with which they have been assailed from several quarters. No commission appointed to inquire into the potato disease could be expected to prove satisfactory to the country. The class most deeply involved in the matter felt no interest whatever in the causes of that disease, their sole"
"attention being directed to the consequences, and hence, the reason why nothing ~"
short of the discovery of a complete remedy could prove satisfactory.
"By this time the greater part of the potatoes have been stored for better or for worse. Nothing farther can be done, therefore, so far as the crop itself is concerned, until the effect of the remedial measures already adopted, be fully tested. There is, however, one question which urgently calls for immediate attention, and that is— What means ought to be adopted for mitigating the bad consequences likely to arise from the loss of a very considerable portion of the food upon which our labouring agricultural population have hitherto mainly depended for subsistence ? It is so far fortunate for the country, at the present juncture, that railway enterprise has opened up, in several quarters, the means of employment, which, to a considerable extent, will absorb the surplus labour of the localities where they are in progress; yet, abundant as this source must be, it cannot adequately overtake, or overcome, the evils that necessarily result from a scarcity of employment throughout the country generally, combined as it is with high- priced provisions, arising from the loss of a crop to which the labourer has been accustomed to trust, as an abundant and cheap source from whence to supply his necessities: besides, if there be no other way of procuring work for the people, than that which railways offer, the large numbers of labourers which may be expected to crowd to these points, must have the effect of raising the supply above the demand, and, as a necessary consequence, of lowering the wages, probably to a point at which the high price of provisions will render it impossible for them to obtain a sufficiency for their support. Unless, therefore, there be some other source of employment opened up, there is too good reason to fear that the condition of the labourers generally, must, for the next nine months, be one of suffering."
"Government aid, rendered in the shape of loans, to enable either public bodies, or private individuals to commence, and carry forward improvements, with a view of"
"©  providing employment for the people, is, undoubtedly, only to be resorted to under extraordinary circumstances; still, the present exigencies are such as fully to justify those to whom the country looks as being, from their station and influence, the natural guardians of its interests, to press upon the legislature the propriety of affording assistance, in some shape or other, in order that the labouring classes may be supplied with the means of earning their subsistence. Improving the soil offers the best means of accomplishing this end; because, by doing so, its resources are developed, and its produce increased—thus offering both present and prospective advantages, by offering scope for labour, and an increased amount of food for future years."
"In a country like Ireland, containing, as it does, upwards of twenty millions of acres—one-fifth of which is at present uncultivated, and a very large proportion of what is cultivated, only producing one-half of that which it is capable of doing, were it properly drained there can be no difficulty in the way of finding a field wide enough for commencing operations on a scale every way commensurate with the wants of the labouring population, even although its numbers were doubled."
"With regard to farm labourers—such as ploughmen— whose engagement with their employers is generally on a more permanent nature than that of the mere day labourer, the loss of the potato crop will be much less felt; yet, as the price of provisions is greatly raised from what it has been for some years, unless the wages be correspondingly increased, they must experience the utmost difficulty in providing food for themselves and families. Their employers ought, therefore, to give an advance of wages to enable them to do so: otherwise they cannot expect the same amount of work to be performed."
"' The generality of farmers will suffer much less from the failure of the potato crop than those who depend principally upon it for food. It is true the crop itself will turn to little account, yet the value of grain and other farm produce has risen twenty per cent, at least, which must go far to supply the deficit in their receipts, caused by the failure of the potato crop, except, perhaps, in those cases where it was very extensively cultivated, and too exclusively depended upon. We would, therefore, call upon proprietors holding land in their own hands, and large farmers, either to raise the wages of their labourers, or to supply them with oatmeal at a lower rate than what it can be obtained in the market. To enable the labourer to purchase the same amount of food this year, he would require to have at least one-fifth added to his wages; and if we take into account the fact, that he must purchase an additional quantity of food this year to supply the loss he has met with from the failure of the potato crop, and upon which in former years he depended so much, one-third more wages will scarcely place him in as favourable circumstances as he was last year, when potatoes were abundant and cheap, and the price of oats only 11s. per barrel. It is certainly not too much to ask the proprietors and farmers either to give their workmen higher wages, or to supply them with what food they may require at a correspondingly cheap rate."
"There is still a class of individuals whose case is more difficult to deal with than either that of the large farmer or labourer—viz., the small farmer, holding, perhaps, only ten acres of land, or, perhaps, in many cases, not half that quantity. To such persons the loss of the potato crop is little short of depriving them of their only"
"144  means of existence, for it is on this that they rely for feeding themselves and families. They are also deprived of the means of feeding their pigs; and, conse- quently, of one principal source from which the rent is usually derived. The following return from the last census, shows the number and extent of farms in Ireland:— ."
"Farms from 1 to 5 acres 306,915 Farms from 5 to 15 acres 251,123 Farms from 15 to 30 acres 78,914"
"Farms above 30 acres 48,312"
"Those upon whom the failure of the potato crop will press most heavily, are fanners holding under fifteen acres of land, and who compose by far the largest proportion of the rent-paying agricultural community. These individuals have no capital to fall back upon in the present emergency. The majority of them are, indeed, although called farmers, little removed from the condition of common labourers, with this difference only, that they are their own masters. In their present circumstances, the very fact of their possessing land will operate against them, inasmuch as they are tied to it, and cannot, therefore, avail themselves of opportunities which labourers differently circumstanced have, of working to others for the means of support. If small farmers are to be harshly dealt with at present, all that has been done within the last few years for the purpose of bettering their condition, and teaching them to improve their land, must go for nought, -or at least or at least their exertions will be so much overstrained in future, that many years must elapse before they can regain the prosperity which they were just about enjoying, before the pestilence swept over their potato crops."
"To distrain for rent, or to forgive it altogether, are both equally objectionable means of dealing with an embarrassed tenant. The better way is for the landlord to be lenient in respect to the time of collecting it, and, also, to render assistance in carrying on improvements on his farm, which, by increasing the produce, will enable him gradually to surmount his present difficulties."
"In concluding these somewhat lengthened remarks, we would press home upon the consideration of all whose position gives them influence and opportunities, the responsibility they are under to bestir themselves to provide remunerative employment for their dependant?, as by doing so they will not merely be performing an act of humanity, but will, also, be adopting the most effectual means of warding off from themselves, the consequences which a scarcity of employment and food among the labouring classes, must otherwise inevitably produce."
THE PULPING MILL
"Farmers Gazette, November 15"""", 1845, page 473"
"siR—Having seen in the Scottish Farmer an allusion to farina, or pulping mill?, extensively and successfully used in the south of Scotland for several vears, I wrote _ to the maker of these machines, A. Dean, Birmingham, requesting him to furnish me"
"O  with a description of them. In reply I was favoured with the following engraving and a description, from which i learn that the grating cylinder is composed of a series of steel cutters, with fine serrated edges, having the appearance of a currycomb. This renders the machine most effective in producing the greatest quantity of farina, and in lessening the labour attending the after process, the extreme fineness of the grater reducing the tubers into a pulp resembling cream."
"This is of the greatest importance, when it is considered necessary to convert the potatoes into the farina or starch of commerce : and where this is intended, I am of opinion, that, unless in large machines, involving all the necessary apparatus, and acted upon by a waterfall, that any modification of such machine, to be turned by hand, must possess some fine grating principle, to compensate for the want of velocity which must be incurred in its adaption to hand labour. Any person who has observed the sawdust falling from a circular saw, when at different degrees of speed, will be able to apprehend that a slow moving grater may be made to tear any quantity of potatoes fo pieces, which may be afterwards pressed, or used as may seem best, but, in order to rasp or grind the potato into a pulp so as to obtain the greatest quantity of starch, the grater must be either finely serated or moving at a great speed. This is the at different degrees of speed, will be able to apprehend opinion I first entertained, and every communication I have had with farilla makers tend to confirm it."

146  THE POTATO CROP
"An Extract from a letter addressed to the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society, by the Irish Waste Land Improvement Society."
"Farmers Gazette, November 15'"", 1845, page 473"
"To this date, although many of our neighbours are suffering considerably, our tenants’ crops are, lam happy to say, comparatively but little injured, a circumstance probably attributable, under Providence, to the early adoption of the following precautions : —"
"During the summer months, the potato fields were closely watched, all decayed stalks were cut off and burnt, and tainted tubers rooted out. When dug, the potatoes were carefully sorted, those infected converted into flour (according to the printed recommendations), a process the tenants have found very easy and productive. The sound potatoes, well dried, were placed on ground in heaps, not exceeding three feet wide, in layers separated from each other by turf-charcoal, lime powdered turf, or dried sand; and on inspection we find no decay in those formed with charcoal and very little in the others."
"At the same time, as whilst hoping for the best, we have felt it necessary to prepare for the worst, we are collecting the oats to keep them in store, as a reserve against the inevitable demands of the summer months; and are planting several small gardens on each estate, with winter potatoes — a mode of cultivation adopted in consequence of a successful experiment on one of our estates (Ballinakil), last year ; where, in the month of November, potatoes (Americans) were planted in coarse, spongy, peaty bog, eight feet deep. thrown up into four-feet ridges, with deep furrows, well manured with stable manure, and produced, when dug, on the 10th July last, a crop perfectly free from disease, averaging sixty barrels, of fourteen stone to the barrel, the plantation acre."
"By these arrangements, the giving to all our people employment, in the general works of the estates, and in the permanent improvement of their own farms, at wages regulated by the price of food, we trust to be able to avert the impending calamity from a somewhat numerous population, and so far to relieve the pressure on the public."
"I may be permitted to add, that the giving constant employment in periods of scarcity and distress, forms no new feature in this society's system. It was laid down as a principle, when the estates were trusted to my management some years since, as explained in the report for 1842, (p. 8) "" that steady employment with fair wages (is afforded) throughout periods of agricultural distress, when the peasantry in general are preserved from starvation by charity, and too often left in a state of idleness, and was attended with the most beneficial results, as further reported on by me in 1843, (see p. 5) that in the periods of great scarcity and distress, the tenants of the society's estates received not the slightest aid or alms from the government, the workhouses, or any charitable fund, but supported themselves by fair wages for labour, and the produce of their own little farms."
"oO  Should it be deemed expedient at this crisis, to enlarge the sphere of the society's operations, and more widely diffuse the benefits now enjoyed by our tenantry, we possess ready and well organized means which mightbe immediately applied to the giving of productive and permanent employment to thousands of the peasantry, in reclaiming the extensive waste lands of the country, if the scale of our finances will -permit."
"POTATO DISEASE Farmers Gazette, November 15'"", 1845, page 473"
"SIR - As an old subscriber I hope you will give insertion to the following remarks, which I think necessary to make on the present occasion, regarding the potato rot:—"
"From the nature of my employment I have the best opportunity of knowing how affairs stand in this part of the country. I regret to say that the greater part of the crop is destroyed, or will very soon be so. I dug some of my potatoes a month since: at that time only one in two hundred was diseased, which I carefully seperated; I turned and dried them thoroughly in the sun, and covered them with grass. On one heap |! put a full covering of clay, on the other I put none. On examining them a few days since, I found those under the clay, in the heart or middle of the heap where they were driest, covered with a white fungus, and nearly all rotten through and through, those next the grass all round the outside, that received some moisture, were perfectly safe. How is this to be accounted for, after all the scientific recommendations about drying ? I am sure only for such theories (from people unacquainted with practical matters) I would have all mine comparatively safe now. Some of the same potatoes I left undug, and they are this day as safe as when I first commenced digging. The part covered with grass only, are gradually getting worse. I am of opinion, and so are hundreds besides, that leaving them in the ground is the best way. Very few people are digging out here at all. I also put a single layer on rather a warm loft quite sound; in one week they were taken down rotten: so much for the theory of kiln-drying. The plans proposed by the Commissioners will not have a single advocate—the people are only laughing at their nonsense. I always pitted mine exactly as Mr. Garden describes; I allow no air or ventilation; the consequence is, that I could have given a guinea (if I had it) for a single failure for the last seven years. Straw is recommended for covering, but worse could not be wished for; it is sufficient in a damp season to rot any potatoes coming in contact with it; I have seen it do so: green grass is the best cover. The disease appears to have begun for the most part at the eyes, which, if closely examined, will be found budding or less: the black spots inside appear as if shot through this sort of bud; in some branching into the very centre. It is of no consequence to know the cause of it: there is no possibility of a cure."
"If potatoes cannot be preserved in pits of a smaller size than usual, covered and cared in the same way, all the remedies of theorists or chemists will be of no avail."
"Yours, &c., A LABOURING MAN, County Roscommon, Nov. 11, 1845."
148  STORING POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, November 15"", 1845, page 473"
"sIR — I take the liberty of submitting to the public, through your valuable paper, a mode of digging and storing the potatoes of the present year, which as it differs in some respects from the others I have as yet heard of, and is simple and cheap in execution, may prove a benefit to many who are now engaged in saving their potato crop. ;"
"While the potatoes were digging, I had the sound separated from the unsound, as well as the gatherers could then distinguish them, placing the sound on one ridge and the unsound on another. I covered each ridge during the night with refuse straw or other dry rubbish of the farm-yard, stripping the potatoes in the day time. This I continued for a week, when I considered the potatoes well fit for packing, ‘and found many of the diseased restored to health. I was for some time at a loss to know the best way to store them for the succeeding year, as the packing stuff recommended by the government commissioners was somewhat expensive, and as I feared the effects of hot lime, I was not a little puzzled how to proceed. A thought occurred to me that mill seeds, which, in most parts of the country, are easily procured, would be an excellent substitute for either ofthe compounds recommended by the commissioners. I then tried their effect upon some of my potatoes which had received rain, and found that, in the short space of an hour, they became perfectly dry, and, in my opinion, I well calculated to stand the winter. I then determined to proceed, adopting, for the most part, the commissioners’ plan in constructing the pit, using, however, turf instead of sods, where they _suggest the latter, and the mill seeds instead of their ""packing stuff."" Currents of air entering the potatoes through the interstices in the turf roof of the pit, will continue that cool and drying ventilation so much desired. The mill seeds, from their dryness, their being perfectly free from the noxious qualities in the hot lime, and their tendency to run down, as it were, between the potatoes, there by preventing contact, seem to afford the people in many localities a cheap and efficacious way of preserving the means of subsistence for the greater part of the coming year."

"ON STORING POTATOES Farmers Gazette, November 15°, 1845, pages 473-474"
"siR—I have read, with much interest,, and not a little profit, the letter of your intelligent correspondent, Mr. Garden, of Dumfries, on ""the Potato, its Disease and Remedy,"" published in the FARMERS' GAZETTE of the 8th instant; but my experience would not go to prove the inefficacy of the plan which he suggests, at the close of his letter, as a means of protecting the growing plant from the effects of puirefaction in the seed. !n the latter end of the month of February, but I found"
"OQ  some tubers of cup potatoes (which had been accidentally left in the potato soil of 1844,) sprouting vigorously. I had several of them carefully raised; I removed the shoots, which were two or three inches tong, from the tubers, and planted the former, in a single row, at one foot asunder, in my garden. They grew well, and produced abundantly, though they were rather late; but, on raising them, fully a third of the produce was found diseased."
"With respect to planting potatoes now, a suggestion, I believe of your own, as a ‘means of guarding against disease next season, I planted whole tubers (Purple- eyed Americans,) in the middle of October, 1844, and, on digging them out, in October last, they proved a most splendid crop, both in size and quantity; but about one in twenty were diseased."
"With respect to placing potatoes in layers, with a view to their preservation-during winter and spring: in October, 1844,1 had some cups and Purple-eyed Americans, intended for seed, placed in layers, at one inch asunder in the layer, and covered with common limestone gravel, to the depth of three inches over each layer, putting only four layers, in this way, over each other, and finishing with a coat of gravel, about six inches deep, on the sides and top, without any other protection whatever. On digging them out, in April last, they proved perfectly sound, and their produce remains, as yet, perfectly free from the prevailing disease—"

"ON STORING POTATOES Farmers Gazette, November 15"", 1845, page 474"
"SIR—I have read in your paper many of the suggestions put forward by correspondents respecting the nature and cause of the present disease which has attacked the potato crop, and, also, the means to be adopted for arresting its progress. But whilst a good many successful experiments have been tried with the latter, the former proposition seems as yet to be involved in mystery."
"From the many experiments which have already been tried, it seems that dryness, with proper ventilation, is essential for stopping the progress of the disease; and even kiln-drying has been recommended previous to pitting; but those who adopt this plan, ought to be on their guard lest, in avoiding one calamity, they meet with another; or, in other words, in trying to save their potatoes from a rot, to which wet seems the principal stimulant, they will be liable to be attacked by its opposite, which is engendered by the total absence of that degree of moisture which is necessary to keep the potatoes in a fit state, either for food or planting; for every practical farmer must be aware, that when digging his potatoes, if the ground be so dry that none of it adheres to them, and pitted in a manner that will preserve them in that dry state, he will be liable to lose a great many of them by the disease I have just mentioned."
"A great deal has been written as to the origin and cause of the present disease,"
"150  whilst some attribute it to mildew fungus, some to electricity, some to the coldness of the season, others to atmospheric changes, &c.; but whatever may be the more immediate cause of the disorder, that the potato has degenerated very much lately, must be obvious to every one; for if the weather be very dry at the planting season, or that the potatoes have got a little heated in the pits, or, in fact, any other cause which might tend slightly to injure their reproductive powers, a partial, if not a total failure, is most likely to be the result. Now the question naturally presents itself, why is it that the treatment which was given to potatoes twenty or thirty years ago, will not answer for them now? which has given rise to much discussion of late."
"The idea has often struck me that our potatoes having been brought from a climate which is much warmer than ours, they are consequently not receiving that nourishment which is necessary to keep them in a sound and healthy state, they have, therefore, gradully degenerated, and got weakly, until, in many instances, when planted, they are quite unable to vegetate. To obviate this, several have tried the experiment of raising potatoes from the apple, thinking, by that means to renew their seed; but in many instances the experiment has proved a failure; and, on the principle that ""like generates its like,"" it could not he otherwise."
"But as the potato is now so generally used, as, in fact, to become almost the sole article of food with the majority in this country, and as every other plan that has been adopted seems to have failed, I think it would at least be worth a trial, to have some brought over from their native soil again, and, by that means, to renew a plant which is so useful, and which seems to be so rapidly on the decline"

A field is entirely infected with the disease except in one place, where two rows are perfectly sound; they are the same kind of potato, and the only reason that the owner can give is, that a sack of the seed was overlooked, and not planted till, as he thought, too late to grow; they thus escaped the hot week in June, which appears to be considered everywhere as a great cause of the disease.—"

"ON THE MANUFACTURE OF POTATO STARCH TAPIOCA, &c."
"(From the Journal of the Highland Society of Scotland) Farmers Gazette, November 15%) 1845, page 476"
"One other subject I am tempted to draw your attention to, from its connection with the natural progress of rural industry in this and similar districts of the country. You know that in the neighbourhood of large towns, the raising of potatoes is a very profitable branch of farming and that this arises in part from the circumstance that the great weight of this crop excludes the distant producer of it from entering into successful competition with the suburban farmers. Hence, where good potato lands occur, and good crops are, or can be, easily raised, at a distance from markets, the tenant is prevented, by the cost of transport, from availing himself, in the greatest degree, of the peculiar qualities of his soil. It is therefore of consequence in such localities to discover a mode of manufacturing the potato into some other commodity of easier transport, and, if possible, of as ready a sale. In the north of Europe, it is a very common thing to attach a distillery to a large farm, for the purpose of working up the potato crop, by converting it into brandy. In our country the farmer cannot adopt this method, but he can convert his potatoes into farina or potato flour. Into this manufacture great improvements have recently been introduced; and the farina is converted into British tapioca, into syrup, and other articles, which find a more or less ready market. The waste fibre of the potato, which formerly was considered fit only for manure, is now converted into a wholesome nourishment for cattle; and even the washings of the starch, where skill and economy preside over the process, are collected and employed as a manure. You recollect the fact mentioned to us as your brother- in-law, Mr. Binning Home, that these washings, when allowed to run into the potato drills, had given, near Stirling, a larger crop of potatoes than was yielded by other parts of the same field, to which guano and farm-yard manure had been"
152  applied.
"The farina, or starch, has hitherto commanded a ready sale in the Liverpool market; and such was the success of one manufactory established in 1843 on the Bay of Wigton, that in 1844 several others were in process of erection, so that the outlet for the potato crop in that locality was greatly increased. And so long as the supply of this farina does not exceed the demand, such manufactories will multiply in the potato-growing districts, and thus the available sources of agricultural profit will be increased. They have already found their way into some of our Highland straths; and both tenant and proprietor have been benefited by the additional value which has thus been given, to their healthy growing potato crops."
"The progress of this branch of industry illustrates the close connection which exists between our manufacturing and agricultural prosperity. The principal buyers of the potato starch have hitherto been the calico-printers, and others engaged in the cotton manufactures. On their prosperity depends the demand for this article, and consequently, all the more remote that our rural districts derive from the demand which this prosperity creates for one of their staple articles of produce. How important, therefore in every point of view, that these manufactories should flourish !"
"There is little reason to doubt that new uses and new outlets for the potato will by- and-by become generally known. The farina is by some bakers mixed, to a certain extent: with their wheaten flour, but there is a prejudice against it, and it is considered in the light of an adulteration. In the form of tapioca it is gradually finding a more extended use and in numerous other forms it is insinuating itself into our daily diet."
"In Germany, a method has lately been introduced of making flour from potatoes, which has: not, I believe been tried in this country, but which is recommended as giving a better, a more palatable, and a more abundant article of nourishment than the common process of preparing potato-starch. This method consists in washing the potatoes, cutting them into slices, as we do turnips, steeping these slices for twenty- four hours in water containing one per cent, of sulphuric acid, (oil of vitriol), drawing off the acid water, washing them several times with pure water, drying them in a stove, and then grinding them in a common corn-mill. The flour thus obtained is pure white, and the refuse sittings or bran seldom exceed five per cent, of the weight of the dried potatoes. The sulphuric acid in this process extracts the colouring matter of the potato, with certain other substances which would give the flour an unpleasant taste. This flour will not make good bread if used alone—it requires to be mixed with from one to one-third of wheaten flour."
"In growing potatoes for the manufacture of starch (farina) an attention to various circumstances is necessary in order to secure the largest yield of this substance. The sod, the manure, the variety of potato, its state of ripeness, and the length of time during which it has been kept, affect the quantity of starch it is capable of yielding. I have elsewhere published the results of numerous researches as to those points. Some unpublished experiments, however, made by our friend Mr. Fleming of Barrochan, last year, (1844,) will be of peculiar interest to you, because they were made upon certain varieties of potato which are commonly"
"O  grown in the west of Scotland, and because they exhibit the action of a manure, guano, now very generally employed in your district. The results of these experiments, which he has communicated to me are exhibited in the following table:—"
"Relative proportions of starch and water contained in 100 Ibs. of different varieties of potatoes manured with dung, with guano, and with half dung and half guano together."

"Remarks.—The potatoes were lifted before they were quite ripe. The starch was made from the whole potatoes well washed not scraped. The starch was dried before an open fire, and the refuse at 300° F. in an oven. I find it difficult to get all the parcels of starch to the same degree of dryness.— W. Fleming."
"There is a great difference, as you will see, in the proportions of starch extracted from these different kinds of potato. The while dons, for example, yielded little more than half of what was obtained from the rough reds. On the whole, the red potatoes seem to be the best starch-givers; and it appears to make little difference whether guano and dung be employed alone or together in the proportions of half dung and half guano. The dinference in the proportion of water between the white dons and the rough reds is very striking, amounting to about 2.5 cwt. in the ton. Such facts as these are of importance both to the starch-maker in buying his potatoes as, and to the grower of potatoes who raises them for sale to the manufacturer."
"As I have said so much on the subject of potatoes, I may as well describe to you a method which has lately been recommended in Denmark and Norway, for making the potato more available and more profitable in feeding cattle than it has ever hitherto been. You are probably aware that potato-starch can be readily con- verted into grape-sugar, and that the syrup obtained from it is largely employed for the manufacture of brandy in the north of Europe, and even of the best brandy which comes from France. In the more northen of the French wine-growing provinces it is alas mixed with the less sweet varieties of grape-juice, so as to give an additional strength and richness to the wine."
"154  One of the methods by which the potato-starch is converted into grape-sugar is, to mix it with one-tenth of its weight of ground malt diffused in water, and to keep the mixture for some hours at a moderate temperature. The starch dissolves, and the liquid becomes sweet from its conversion into grape-sugar. This is the method which M. Boggild of Copenhagen proposes to apply to the whole potato, in order to bring it into a soluble state, to make it more easy of digestion, and thus to increase its feeding properties. :"
"He washes his potatoes well, steams them thoroughly, and then, without allowing them to cool, he cuts them in a cylinder furnished internally with revolving knives, or crushes them in a mill, and mixes them with a small quantity of water and three pounds of ground malt to every 100 Ibs. of the raw potatoes. This mixture is kept in motion and at a temperature of from 140° to 180° F., for from one to five hours, when the thick gruel has acquired a sweet taste and is ready for use. Given in this state, the results of experimental trials are said to be-"
"4st, That it is a richer and better food for milk cows, than twice the quantity of potatoes in the raw state."
"2nd, That it is excellent for fattening cattle and sheep and for winter food; that it goes much farther than potatoes when merely steamed; and that it may be economically mixed up with chopped hay and straw. I have before me a pamphlet, published at Christiania by the Royal Society for Promoting the Improvement of Noway, in which this method is strongly recommended; also a letter from Copenhagen, dated 29th April 1845 in which my correspondent writes as follows:—""This nvention ~ has been more and more appreciated and applied in my native country (Norway) and in Denmark, and the great advantages with which stall feeding may be introduced, at considerably less expense than formerly, render it suited to general promulgation. The method has more and more gained adherents; and further comparative experiments, made by scientific and experienced persons, have proved its superiority. Thus one of these experiments establishes that an increase of 1.5 Ibs. of flesh is obtained from 25 Ibs. of potatoes— that the feeding of horses with this mash is found to be applicable and cheap; and they all confirm that potatoes used in this manner as food, amply afford double the nutritive powers compared to the food formerly used."".."
"I cannot here state my reasons for believing that here is really something worthy of attention in the illeged superior feeding qualities of the potato given in this state; but I can strongly recommend you to make experiments upon the subject. If the potato can in this way be converted into a larger quantity of beef ,mutton, or pork, than hitherto, another outlet will be provided for the potato crop, which may, perhaps, prove more profitable even than the manufacture of it into flour."
"Had'l not already greatly exceeded the limits even of a printed letter, I should have told you of the fine stock I saw at Baldoon—of the pertinacity with which barley refuses to grow on some of the soils in "" The Machars,"" while it grows well on others very near them, and apparently similar—and of the delight which most of the farmers of the district appear to have in seeing their liquid manure descend to the sea, and in supplying its place with guano. But I must conclude by sub- scribing myself yours very truly,"

ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF IRELAND
"COUNCIL MEETING—THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1845."
"Farmers Gazette, November 22%, 1845, page 484"
"Present—Sir Geo, Hodson. Bart., in the chair; Rt. Hon. E. Lucas, Robert Bodkin, Win. B. Wade, John Ross Mahon, William Owen, Charles Doyle, J. B. Bankhead, Wra. Jones Armstrong, Professor Kane, Charles Roper, Henry Ryan, Thomas Hutton, Win. Smith O'Brien, M.P., Win. Donnelly, Acheson Lyle, and Thomas Ball, Esqrs., members of the council. John Sproule, John Owen, Doctor Hodges, Pierce Mahony, Esqrs., members of the society."
"The secretary read a number of communications from different persons, connected with the prevailing disease in the potato crop; and, among the rest, from Colonel Robinson, secretary to the Waste Land Improvement Society, describing the mode in which they had endeavoured to avert the evil on their estates. Ordered to be referred to the Managing Committee for their consideration."
"The secretary reported, that the judges had attended on the Friday preceding at the Royal Dublin Society, Kildare-street, for the purpose of deciding on the different machines for grinding potatoes, exhibited for the society's two premiums of ten guineas each, and that after having examined the same most carefully, they had awarded the first prize for large machines to Mr. Richard Robinson, of Lisburn, for the three best exhibited for that purpose. The prices being £15, £6, and £3 respectively."
"Professor Kane called the attention of the council to the propriety of offering premiums, in the different local farming societies, next year, for the best crops and greatest quantities of potatoes grown from the original seed or berries of potatoes, for the purpose of encouraging that system of cultivation as much as possible."
"156  The suggestion was a most important one, and had come from a very high quarter; and if the central society could carry it into effect, it would be productive of the greatest possible benefit."
"The council fully admitted the importance of the question. They were also most desirous that no time should be lost in saving the potato apples, and planting them as extensively as possible; and, in fact, it was every man's duty to do so, by way of experiment in such as emergency. But it was entirely a question of funds with the council, as any additional premiums were at present beyond their means, when they considered the limited funds, and the great increased demands upon ‘the available resources of the society. It was agreed, however, that the question - should be allowed to lie over until the next meeting of the council, and that, in the meantime, it should be referred, together with the list of premiums to local societies for next year, to the managing committee, to consider the same, previous to the nest general meeting. ."
"Mr. Roper also gave notice that he would move, at the next meeting of the council, that it be suggested to the government, to consider the propriety of affording every encouragement and facility to the importation of sound potatoes for seed, from those foreign districts which have not hitherto been affected by the disease. The question of seed for next year was clearly and distinctly within their province, and it was their duty to direct public attention, by every means in their power, to such an important question."
"The Council had also devoted much attention to investigating the different plans proposed for manufacturing and preserving the potato, particularly in its partially diseased state, with the object of preserving as much of the original article as possible for consumption; for there was no doubt that the indiscriminate manufacture of farina or potato starch alone, without due preservation of the solid bulk of the potato itself, would only add to the present evil, by diminishing even still more the quantity of available food in the country. For this purpose they had received two communications on the subject: the -first from Mr. Robert Pooler, alluded to at the last meeting, and the other from Dr. Hodges, of Downpatrick acting’ chemist to the Northern Chemical Association. The object of both gentlemen was to manufacture an article somewhat similar to wheatn meal or household flour, which, mixed with other flour or meal, will make excellent cakes or bread, and be capable of being kept, when properly dry, from season to season."
"Mr. Pooler's plan was as follows :—The potatoes were first carefully washed, and all grit or eand picked out of the eye. They need not be peeled, as the best portion of the farina is deposited near the surface, and would be lost by peeling. They are then ground to pulp in the usual way, either by a hand grater, or by one of those machines now in general use for the purpose. The farina is then separated by passing through a gauze strainer, and deposited in a trough of water, where it is allowed to settle for an hour or so. The water is then drawn off, leaving the farina at the bottom of the vessel, which is then to be spread out on a clean boarded floor previous to the final process of drying, which is afterwards perfected. The water is next to be drawn off the grated pulp, which is to be pressed and squeezed until it forms a compact mass, which is then broken into small"
"O  pieces, and dried in the usual manner, and which from its porous nature, and capacity of bearing a high degree of temperature compared to the farina, is a comparatively easy process."
"it is desirable to prepare and dry the farina separately from the pulp, as it not only comes off in the first water, but will run into jelly, if submitted to a higher temperature than 160 degrees. During the process of drying, it ought both to be ""stirred and turned constantly, and the lumps broken, and when perfectly dry, then mixed together, forming the original potato in a state of flour, and about 29 per cent, in weight and bulk of the entire, while it contains all the nutritious matter."
"Pure farina will keep for weeks in a moist state, but the pulp must be dried .is soon as possible, as it soon becomes discoloured, and runs to putrefaction."
"The plan proposed by Doctor Hodges, the particulars of which have been detailed, in full, in the Northern Whig, and other newspapers, was as follows :—To slice the potatoes as you would turnips for sheep, and then to steep them in a weak solution of sulphuric acid and water (one penny worth of oil of vitriol to a tub of water will be sufficient), and leave them steeping for twenty-four hours. On drawing off the water, the slices will be found of a white colour, the vitriol-water having carried away everything injurious. The slices are then to be perfectly dried, which can be done in a corn-kiln where they ought to be spread out in thin layers and turned frequently, until all the moisture is expelled. The potatoes thus dried can afterwards be ground into the finest meal, as white as ordinary flour, equal to 30 per cent, of the original potato, and when perfectly dry, will keep for years. When mixed with a fourth part of flour, oat-meal, or bean-meal, it will make excellent bread or cakes, and be applicable to all other culinary purposes."
"The council expressed themselves much pleased with the specimens of meal and flour, that were produced as the result of both experiments, the principal difference of which appeared to be, that in Mr. Pooler's plan the potato was first ground into pulp, and the farina and fibre prepared separately and then dried; while in Dr. Hodges's plan, the potato was dried first, and then ground afterwards in any of the common flour-mills of the country."
"The council being anxious to test the merits of these different plans, a sub- committee was appointed, consisting of Sir Robert Fergusson, M.P.; William Smith O'Brien, M.P.; Thomas Hutton, J. B. Bankhead, and Dr. Kane, to be associated with Doctor Hodges, at the Royal Dublin Society, in instituting an experiment for the purpose, in order to report to the Council at their next meeting."
"It was then agreed that the day for holding the next general half-yearly meeting of the society should be fixed at the next council, on which occasion the premium sheet for the cattle show, at Limerick, could be agreed to, the day for the show announced, and the premiums decided for local farming societies for the ensuing year. The council then adjourned until Thursday next."

"On Friday evening a meeting of the above society took place, Doctor Croker, _M.LR.LA., in the chair. Dr. Bellingham, on being called on to read his paper on the "" potato disease,"" said—The subject to which I propose to call the attention of the society this evening, is one which has engrossed a large share of public attention for some time past, and deservedly so, the integrity of the potato crop being of the utmost importance to the peasantry of this country, constituting, as it does, not only the exclusive food of the majority, during the greater part of the year, but the refuse enables them to feed and rear their pigs, by which many in addition are enabled to meet their rent, or to add slightly to their comforts, at best so very few. In the following communication I intend to state what I have observed myself of this disease, as I had the opportunity of seeing it upon its first appearance, and of watching its progress from day to day, during a visit of several weeks in the country. I wish, however, to observe, that if I had not announced my intention of reading a paper on the subject, some time since, to the secretary of the society, I should have hesitated before I entered a field occupied by so many scribblers. The subject being one in which every body is more or less interested every person who has seen, much less eaten, a disease potato, thinks himself competent to form an opinion and thinks it therefore incumbent upon him to publish his crude ideas on the subject. History of the Disease"
"The potato crop, during the month of July and beginning of August, this year, looked particularly well. There was a luxuriousness of the leaves, flowers, and stalks, which led most people to suppose that there would be an unusual yield, and that the crop would be more than an average one. During the last fortnight of the month of August the weather became very warm—during several days the heat was excessive, and the days were succeeded by cold nights. The air at the time was apparently in a highly electric state; and the country people on the sea coast say that lightning was observed over a wide extent of the horizon, which appeared to come from the direction of the sea, or the east coast, and cross the country towards the west. The first signs of the disease were observed during the last fortnight of the month of August, immediately after the sultry days mentioned. The leaves of the potato plant were found to be dotted with a number brownish- black spots of variable size, or the edge point of one or more of the leaflets became brown, curled up, dried, and withered. This extended to the others, until the whole leaf was shriveled. It commenced upon the uppermost leaflets, was always most marked in them, and extended downwards: sometimes the uppermost leaves were withered, while those lower down were still green. The stalk of the plant was not discoloured until all the leaves had dried up. It did not extend in the same proportion over the whole field, in some ridges the leaves were discoloured and shriveled while those in neighbouring ridges were still green. Eventually the leaves entirely withered, the stalks became white and dry, and the fields presented the appearance in the middle of September (or about a month from the time it was first noticed) that they ordinarily do in the middle of November."
"o)  This decay in the leaves made its appearance in the majority of cases before the fruit had been fully formed. in places where it had arrived at maturity, it was not spotted or marked like the leaves, but preserved its colour after the stalk had withered. The appearance presented by the tuber varied according to the stage of the disease. In the early stage the tubers presented upon their surface patches of a livid colour, and of larger or smaller size at those points, the cuticle readily separated. On cutting into them, the centre was sound; but underneath the livid blotches, to the depth of a line, the surface had a yellowish brown colour; they gave out an unpleasant smell at this stage. When the disease was more advanced, the greater part of the surface of the tuber had a dirty, livid colour; when taken in the hand it felt less firm than natural upon one side, or over whole surface; when cut into it was found to be softened at one side, and this part had a dull, dirty, yellow colour and a watery liquid escaped which yielded an unpleasant smell. These observations were made between the 16th and 22nd of September, at which time the leaves and stalks in the majority of the potato fields were’ completely withered, and the peculiar disagreeable odour given out, was perceptible at a distance, and even passing along the roads. The diseased appearance in the tubers did not, however, keep pace with, or bear proportion to, the decay of the leaves; for in many places where the stalks were entirely gone, the potatoes were perfectly sound; while, in others, many tubers in an early, and some in an advanced stage, were found, although the leaves were but partially withered, and this in different parts of the same field. Where the potatoes had been planted late, many of the tubers dug at this time were below the average size, and some of them so small as not to be worth digging. The variety of the potato in which, at this time, I found the disease most strongly marked, was that called the peeler. In one locality I found, in a few instances, every tuber upon the set to be more or less diseased; in others, one or two upon a set were in an advanced state of decay, and the rest not larger than marbles. The next was the Scotch-grey—a_ kind introduced into the country about thirteen or fourteen years ago: next came the Scotch-whites, and the lumper potato; a white, sound, early potato, called the white rounds, and a long, black potato, called long blacks, were almost perfectly round, although the stalk and leaves had completely withered like the rest. The cup and apple potato, at this time, were supposed to have escaped. During the month of September the weather continued fine and dry, and the disease appeared to make little progress. Very wet weather, however, set in at the beginning of October; a week subsequent to which a material change for the worse was observed; and I found every fifth or sixth potato affected in a field where, previously, not above one in twenty was diseased. The cup and apple potato, which had been comparatively sound, were now engaged, but not to the same extent as the others—every set of which, in some parts of the field, had one tuber with the livid patches already described. In a few cases all the tubers in the same set were diseased, and one of them was then always softened either in part, or through its entire substance, and gave out the peculiar characteristic odour. The potatoes planted in drills were as much affected as those in ridges; and those in sandy soil as much as in heavy clay lands; and in thorough-drained ground as much as in ground which had not been drained. A disease analogous to the one I have described was observed in Canada, over a large extent of country, in the autumn of 1844, vague accounts of which have gone abroad. I had a communication from a gentleman who was resident in Canada, during the period in question, which I shall read, as it serves to show the identity of the disease in the two countries, and"
"160  as, in some respects, the circumstances under which it occurred were similar in both."
"SOME ACCOUNT OF THE DISEASE WHICH ATTACKED THE POTATO IN CANADA, DURING THE AUTUMN OF 1844."
"in the spring of 1844, I planted a field of about three acres with potatoes of various descriptions. The field was situated upon the slope of a mountain about three miles from Montreal; the soil was alluvial upon limestone rock. It had been hand-dug throughout, the previous autumn, for the purpose of removing roots, granite boulders, &c., and in order to level the ground, which was virgin soil, never previously having been turned up. I manured the entire field with old stable manure, chiefly with the view of stimulating the growth of the young apple, pear, and cherry-trees, which were planted in it. One quarter of an acre consisted of new varieties recently raised from seed; and I seldom have seen a crop that gave greater promise: some of the leaves were unusually large, with thick vigorous stalks. During the months of July and August we had repeated and heavy showers, with oppressive heat, and an atmosphere strongly charged with electricity. Towards the close of the month of August I observed the leaves to be marked with black spots, as if ink had been sprinkled over them; they began to wither, emitting a peculiar offensive odour, and before a fortnight, the field, which had been singularly luxuriant and almost rank, became arid and dried up, as if after a severe frost. I had the potatoes dug out during the month of September, when about two-thirds were either positively rotten, partially decayed and swarming with worms, or spotted with brownish-coloured patches, resembling flesh that had been frost-bitten. These parts were soft to the touch; and upon the decayed potatoes I observed a whitish substance like mould. The smell from the diseased potatoes was so offensive that some farmers would not even plough them up. The disease extended over several hundred miles of country, including Lower and Upper Canada, and the Northern States. The disease was not universal: some farmers in the low-lands, near my residence, escaped, while their neighbours suffered so much that (as I have observed) they would not plough up the crop, satisfied that it would not pay the outlay, and fearing for their health. Several instances occurred where pigs, having fed upon the diseased potatoes unboiled, died. One diseased potato infected a heap of many tons, and much of the crop was lost in this way. Many persons attributed the calamity to electricity; it was previously unknown in the couniry, and occurred during a period of great heat. It has occurred again in Canada this year: so at least the newspapers state. CAUSES OF THE DISEASE"
"With respect to the causes, or the supposed causes, of this disease, it will now be necessary to say a few words. In order, however, to a proper understanding of the subject, it will be necessary to make a short digression. The tuber of the potato is not a root as was formerly erroneously supposed, but a peculiar kind of stem, termed, from this circumstance, a subterranean stem. The functions performed by this variety of stem are to store up a sufficient supply of nutriment for the development of the buds (or eyes as they are commonly termed) until they are able to derive it from other sources, and thus to assist in the propagation of the plant. The tuber of the potato takes a considerable time to arrive at maturity, and the young potato as everybody knows; is watery. In the majority of cases the growth of this 'year was rapid, evidenced by the luxuriousness of the foliage, and the tubers had not arrived at maturity when the changes which had been"
"O  described occurred in the leaves. The leaves of the potato, as of other plants, serve a very important office during their growth—as soon this is accomplished they wither and decay. Now, if the leaves wither before the tuber of the potato has arrived at maturity, those changes which are essential to enable the tubers to keep are no longer performed, and under ordinary circumstances they would decay early. In fact, in almost every instance, when I had the opportunity of making and examination, the late-planted potato suffered first, and the early-planted potato suffered last; the decay of the leaves having occurred at a time when the tubers of the early-planted potato were more fully developed than the others, and, therefore, more capable of resisting the effects of moisture and of atmospheric changes. Potatoes also grown in gloomy and damp places, where trees were numerous, and the light and air were intercepted, suffered early, and ran more quickly to decay. I do not, however, regard either the rapid vegetation, or the early decay of the leaves of the potato plant, per se, or combined, as the causes of the present disease; I look upon them merely as elements which contributed to place the tubers in a condition to be easily affected by atmospheric or other changes. The causes of the disease are to be sought in the circumstances which occasioned the remarkable appearance and decay in the leaves. By many of the continental authorities, the disease has been referred to the attacks of certain minute parasitical fungi; no doubt, several species of fungi are found upon the diseased tubers; but they are to be regarded as the effect of the decay of the parts, not as the cause of the disease. In fact, the species which I have mentioned as occurring under the form of white patches, like mould, was only found upon tubers in the second stage of the disease, never in the very earliest But supposing, for argument sake, that fungi were the cause of the disease, the difficulty is not solved;it is still more difficult to account for their sudden and simultaneous appearance, in so many distinct localities, inasmuch as fungi are not developed spontaneously or accidentally; but each individual is reproduced by a body somewhat analogous to the seed in the higher divisions of the vegetable kingdom. Certain minute animals have been also observed to inhabit the diseased tubers, and they were, at first, supposed to have some connection with it; but they are only such as feed upon decaying and dead vegetable matter. By some, the disease has been attributed to the use of guano, or other kinds of manure. This, however, evidently had nothing to do with it. By others, want of care in the selection of the seed has been supposed to be a cause; but the disease showed itself in places where the utmost attention had been paid to this point. Others again have endeavoured to account for it by the faulty mode of cultivation; but potatoes planted in drills suffered equally with those in ridges, and, in some instances, even more. By others, the disease has been referred to wetness in the soil; but it has occurred in every situation and in every soil, in dry sandy soils as well as in heavy clay lands, in thorough-drained, as well as in undrained ground; indeed, in some fields the highest and driest parts were those in which the disease first showed itself. In bog lands the potatoes have, in some measure, escaped; but this is to be attributed to the antiseptic nature of the soil, which checked further decay in the tubers; and probably also prevented the diseased, from infecting the sound potatoes. None of the causes which have been enumerated, however, could have had more than a partial effect; any or all of them may have been in operation in former years when nothing of the kind occurred. We must, therefore, look to some general and universal cause, which acted equally upon potatoes planted in sandy, as in clayey soils, upon those sown in high ground as upon those in low situations, upon the rich man's potatoes as well as on the poor man's. That the cause was atmospheric, I think there can be little doubt; but that it depended upon heat or cold, dampness, or dryness"
"162  of the atmosphere is not probable, because we have had seasons very similar to the last, when nothing like the present disease was observed; because we had not the same kind of weather here in the spring, and summer, which prevailed upon the Continent; and particularly, because the disease was more destructive in Canada than in this country, where the weather was more settled.and much warmer. Almost the only condition of the atmosphere, therefore, to which it can be referred is to an electric state; but the exact mode in which this acted upon the leaves in causing them to wither, and upon the tubers in producing the appearances which have been"
". described, is one of those problems which is as difficult to solve as the origin of many of the diseases which now affect the human species, and winch were unknown in the earliest areas."
‘REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASE
"In order to check the progress of the disease, it was proposed at first (and was carried into effect in several places) to cut down the stalks of the potato, on the supposition that the disease in the tubers was caused by the development of parasitical fungi upon the leaves and stalks, which were thus propagated to the former. I need not say this proceeding could have no effect, and where it was practiced it was not followed by any beneficial results. It has been also recommended to delay the digging of the potatoes, and to leave the crop in the ground to the longest possible period, and afterwards to let them lie upon the surface exposed to the air for some days, in order that they may become dry. This advice appears to me to be exceedingly injudicious. We have seen that the tubers this year are particularly predisposed to run into decay. Nothing favours this so much as moisture, and, in a variable climate like ours, to leave them long in the ground is to subject them to the influence of the very cause which should be avoided. To lay them upon the surface of the ground afterwards for some days, with the hope of their becoming drier, is even more suicidal advice. I have seen many instances where potatoes, in the early stage of the disease, were thrown aside on the furrows (as was, indeed, the common practice with the people at first), which, in a few days, became perfectly unfit for food, though when dug they were but little damaged. I have no hesitation in saying that the potatoes in the ground now ought to be dug at once, and if this had been done earlier, a larger proportion would have been saved. There is one point connected with the digging of the crop which, if observed, would save much future trouble, viz.:—Where one tuber upon a set presents marks of the disease, it is very certain that it will show itself upon all the rest on the same set; these, therefore, _ ought to be set aside, and the sets in which all the tubers are sound alone held over for keeping. With respect to the mode of preserving the crop, experience has sufficiently shown that the potatoes should not be pitted in the ordinary way. Owing to the several causes which have been mentioned, they are very liable to heat, and a few diseased potatoes will infect a large number. They should, in the first instance, be removed quickly under cover—the tubers upon the sound sets being completely separated from those on the diseased sets; those should be spread on a floor, and dried as much as possible by exposure to the air, but not heaped; they should at first be frequently turned and examined, and any which give evidence of decay should be removed at once. If the storehouse admit of a current of air through it, so much the better. After they have lost a certain amount of moisture, they may be placed in larger heaps, dry bog earth being mixed with them. The application of artificial heat, as by kiln-drying, or of lime, would probably"
"im) La  prevent them from vegetating if kept over for seed. That the precautions I have mentioned will not only preserve the sound tubers, but that it will check the progress of the disease in the affected potatoes, has been practically proved in several instances, some of which have come to my knowledge, where, however, the experiments were made only upon a small scale. But to endeavour to preserve the diseased tubers in this way, would be attended with more trouble than they are worth. With respect to the treatment of the diseased tubers, those iu the early stage may be employed as food, if they are used soon, and if the diseased part be removed; or they may be given to cattle; or they may be sliced and kiln- dried, so as to remove the greater part of the water, which could not be effected in their entire state; or they maybe converted into meal, or they may be boiled or steamed, and the product dried by artificial heat, as recommended by Professor Davy. It would, however, be out of place here to enter upon the various methods which have been proposed of treating diseased tubersor to discuss the question whether it is preferable to convert them into farina, or to boil, or to steam them, and mash, and preserve in air tight — which process preserves the greatest amount of the nutritive matter of the potato, whichever can be effected with the greatest facility in each particular district, and is best adapted to the stage of decay of the tubers should be selected. But while discussions without end upon these comparatively trifling matters are taking place, the principal point, viz.. the preservation of the portion of the crop which is still sound, is neglected by the people. The potatoes are either left in the ground, subject to all the influences which promote decay, or they are placed in pits of some kind, or if in covered places, they are heaped together so as to be liable to heat, or the diseased tubers are not, in the first instance, kept from contact with the sound. In my mind, the greatest difficulty will be found in the apathy and indifference of the peasantry, and in their dislike to innovations in the mode of storing their potatoes, and the worst consequences are to be apprehended from it. The characteristic of the peasantry of this country is not to look much beyond the present hour; they find no scarcity of food at present, and many of them (from what has gone abroad) are probably impressed with the idea that they will be remunerated for their loss out of some public fund, or in some other way and hence they are careless and little disposed to take the necessary trouble to preserve what remains sound of the crop. The people ought to be taught, that unless they put their shoulders to the wheel, they must, under any circumstances, be the greatest sufferers. Every encouragement, therefore, ought to be given to them, and every facility offered to enable them to store the sound tubers, and to preserve the nutritious matter of the diseased ones. If prizes were offered, and pecuniary rewards held out to those who exerted themselves most in saving their crops, or who could show the largest return of sound potatoes from a given quantity of ground, it might have some effect. But if not, they ought to be entreated, nay, even compelled, if necessary, to adopt the means necessary for the preservation of the crop, a sufficient amount of which, I believe, still remains sound to serve as food during the winter months.—"

"IN consequence of a very large proportion of the potato crop being already irrecoverably lost, and much of what is now considered safe likely to go the same road, there is every reason to apprehend a serious scarcity of food during the coming year. In such circumstances it becomes a public duty to call attention to the consideration of such practicable means as may be within the reach of the farmers themselves, for providing against an impending calamity, which if not ‘amounting to an absolute famine, is at least, of a nature too pressingly importunate to admit of the smallest delay in taking the necessary steps to mitigate its severity. The ordinary food of the people is rapidly diminishing in quantity, and its quality is such as to render only a portion of it available as nourishment for human beings: a greater amount of oat meal must, therefore, be consumed to supply the place of the potato, and hence this source must also become more quickly exhausted than usual. How long the ordinary sources of food may remain unexhausted, or be accessible to the bulk of the poorer classes, it is impossible to calculate with any degree of certainty; yet it is but too probable that, when summer arrives, the common necessaries of life will be so dear as to be almost beyond the reach of the agricultural labourer. An early and abundant harvest next year would, in some measure meet the exigencies of the country, or, at least, shorten the period of suffering; yet, as such an occurrence is altogether a matter of uncertainty. It behoves us to adopt such modes of sowing and cultivating our crops as will be most likely to bring them to maturity before the ordinary period of harvest, and be ready for use at a, time when the deficiencies of the present crop will be most severely felt. Our first object should be, to force forward some culinary vegetable that may come in to use early in summer so as to supply the place of potatoes not one of which, it is to be feared, will be left; by that time; and, secondly, to sow such kinds of grain now that may come to maturity at an earlier period than usual, and thus help to eke. out the present corn crop until general harvest arrives."
"To effect the first of these objects, the most obvious plan is for every farmer to set about planting, immediately, a few roods, or acres, (according to the size of his farm,) with York cabbages and early potatoes. To secure the second, viz., an early corn crop, here, and the more hardy varieties of oats may be sown, such as Siberian, Dun, or Black Tartarian. The planting of cabbages in winter is attended with no great risk or difficulty when the land has been previously well prepared and pulverized; and potatoes are even more safe when planted in winter than late in spring, the ground also requiring less preparation."
"These crops, if planted now, would come into use in succession during the summer (provided different plantings of the cabbages were made) and yield an abundant supply of vegetables for the pot. Cabbage plants may probably be difficult to get in such quantities as the carrying out of these suggestions on an extensive scale would require, few farmers having raised them in beds, yet the gardeners throughout the country, will be able so far to supply the demand; moreover, every landlord should strip his garden entirely of plants, rather than allow the small farmer and cottier to want, what probably may constitute the principal portion of"
"O  his daily food next summer. But this is not all that landlords should content themselves with; in regard to assisting their poorer tenants and cottiers to plant winter crops, they should put their hands in their pockets, and purchase guano to enable them to manure the ground so as to make these crops successful. Planting cabbages on an unmanured soil would indeed be but a miserable prospect for the poor man to look forward to; every means must therefore be adopted for making the plan a successful one, otherwise it would be better to let it alone altogether. Planting potatoes in winter, is, independently of the advantage to be derived from an early supply next year, perhaps, the safest mode that can be adopted for obtain- ing a crop at all. It is perfectly certain, that the potatoes of this year's crop, even the best of them, must be sadly deficient in vegetative vigour, which the drying with hot lime, by ventilation, and other processes they have been subjected to, has in no way tended to improve; and consequently, it is but too probable that the spring planting of next year will be more than ordinarily hazardous. Under such circumstances we cannot hesitate to advise the planting of potatoes now, as at least worthy of trial. To multiply the chances of success, several modes of planting potatoes should be had recourse to, and also at different times throughout the winter and spring. It ought to be remembered as an addition the inducement for adopting the plan suggested, of performing the operation as soon as possible, that the early planted potatoes, last year, in many instances, altogether escaped the disease; and although the same circumstances winch originated that disease may not again recur, it is but common prudence to provide against such a casualty. There is this objection to planting potatoes in winter, that the land can neither be worked or cleaned so perfectly as in spring, and also that there is seldom sufficiency of manure for laying on the land so early in the year."
"There are few farmers who have not, at least, some portion of their stubble fields, where cleaning is not required, and upon which potatoes may be planted without much preparatory working. With regard to manure, its presence can be dispensed with, during winter, and the potatoes will germinate even more readily without than with it, and its absence can be supplied in spring, by artificial aids. Where the land is dry, the most convenient way of planting potatoes is to plough it in moderately wide ridges, (six yards) and during the operation to put in the seed (uncut) every third furrow. On wet soils half this breadth will be safer. The open furrows should be well deepened by the plough, or spade, in order that they may act as drains to carry off surface water. The more common modes of panting in drills, or in lazy- beds, may also be adopted with safety, provided the spaces between these be sufficiently deepened to keep the land perfectly free from stagnant water."
"We throw out these suggestions, well knowing the many difficulties that farmers, will have to contend against in carrying them into execution, yet the objects ought to be attained are important and so connected with the all absorbing question of procuring food for the people, at a season when scarcity. is likely to be felt most severely, that we need scarcely to apologise for the length to which our remarks have extended; and we would again call upon landlords, as well as tenants, to bestir themselves in every possible way; and, so far as lies within their power, to provide against a famine next summer, by sowing early, in order that they may reap early."
166  ON THE CAUSE OF THE POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, November 22""4, 1845, pages 490-491"
"siR—lIt is said the disease ""is spread over the range of the whole world where the plant is cultivated."" What cause, open to the investigation of chemistry, entomology, or mycology, can be assigned as likely to affect the"
"""plant, in so short a period, over such an extent of range? Cholera, some years’"
"ago, spread, over a range as extensive. What would have been thought of a - proposal to raise by subscription £500 to investigate its nature and cause ? Yet it was as much a subject of investigation as the present disease. Who could detect the miasma which gradually brought the malady to our isle ? The virus, or poison, is known only by its effects on organic matter. It is quite beyond the reach of our senses. We have no means of directly estimating or describing it; we cannot separate it from the air, and know nothing of its chemical properties."
"Moist or wet air is much more solvent of organic matters than dry air; and we know that moist air favours the spread of epidemic diseases, while dry air cheeks their propagation. In Africa, the Harmatton. (a very dry wind) puts an end to all epidemics; and it is even said that while it blows, infection is not easily communicated (as by innoculation) by art (Dr. Paria)."
We have often heard the wet character of the past season blamed as the cause of the potato disease; but we have had wet seasons before without this disease; and I have not seen any attempt to explain the operation of this cause.
"In Britain, the disease appeared first in the Isle of Wight and the south- eastern counties. There the season is earlier, and the heat greater than in our quarter. It appeared on the Continent earlier than on our isle; and the east wind blew when it first reached Britain."
"Now, suppose that the heat, after rains, caused much evaporation from the potato fields and potato stems about and after the 20th July, and that the organic matter carried up in the vapour was changed into a poisonous form by the agency of air and the predisposing agency of the subtle gas carried on the east wind from the infected districts in Belgium, and acting as /eaven to bring the ascending vapour into its own state. Suppose next, that in the cold nights which followed the hot days, part of this poisonous gas was carried down in dew to the potato leaves, and we have a bird's-eye view of what likely took place."
"Concurrent testimony seems to prove, beyond doubt, that in the warmer districts, and in warmer soils, the disease first affected the leaves, while in colder, later, higher districts it as evidently did not attack the leaves, but began its ravages much later in the season, and at the old seed, or root part of the stem. A little attention easily reconciles these apparent discrepancies. In a wet season like the past the plants, in warm soils and climes, grew unusually tender and succulent, and thus were predisposed to infection from even a small portion of an infecting matter; while"
"O  those on colder, later soils, being much less advanced, and perhaps more hardy, were able to resist all the contagion. or miasma then in the air, and stood uninjured till frost destroyed their leaves. Here we had frost on the soil in the morning of the 16th September, and again on the nights of the 23rd and 24th; yet my potatoes were perfectly sound, as daily raised for the table, till the uninterrupted rain with strong, easterly wind of the 3rd October. My inference from this is that the rain, blown over an extensive infected region, came loaded with the infecting matter, and at once conveyed to the roots enough of the poison to act first on the dead seed, and from it extend to the living tubers."
"Among animals we see some individuals and breeds much sooner affected by contagious disease than others; we find the same difference in the susceptibility of different varieties of wheat; hence, we may expect some varieties of the potato to be much more liable to infection than others. It is also to be expected that the wind will not in all places be equally impregnated or loaded with the poison; that which has blown over many miles of high moorland, and a large breath of sea may be . expected purer than what has blown over a near infected district. As those in drained, peaty soils seem to be comparatively exempt, we may infer the likelihood that peat mould absorbed or destroyed so much of the poison (carried down by rain,) as, to a large extent, to preserve the crop."
"We find that many diseases which are not contagious in a mild form, and in some states of the air, yet become powerfully contagious when they reach a certain stage, and in different states of the atmosphere."
"The almost universal prevalence of the disease this season seems quite inexplicable on any supposition but that of its being conveyed in the air by a specific contagion. This supposition affords the easiest explanation of every fact I have seen or met with; and if it be correct, what can chemists, entomologists, and mycologists do in the matter ?"
"The chemist is, perhaps the most helpless of the three. He has already analysed sound and diseased potatoes with the most scrupulous accuracy; yet his results indicate nothing in point. I might as soon, on disease appearing suddenly in a flock, take a sound and a diseased sheep, burn the body of each, and analyse their ashes, to discover from this the nature of the disease, and learn how to cure the rest. Chemistry is of great value in its own province; but it cannot do everything. The entomologist may look at the insects which prey on the dead matter, and give us hard terms enough to describe their classification; but he cannot blame them as the cause of the disease. He might as well blame the insects and venues in a churchyard for the death of those interred in it. And the mycologist may describe the mould or fungi which appear on the stem and tubers; but the only fact he can infer from their presence is, that the decaying potato affords suitable food for them. He may answer some questions to which I referred in a former article, and their answer may be of use to guide our hopes and conduct next season; but his labours in this are no more than will be gratuitously performed by many. When the talents of the most competent persons in Europe are anxiously and gratuitously engaged on the same subject, why should disrespect be shown to their labours by hiring a favoured few not more competent than many others. A much better course would have been to raise a fund to bestow honorary premiums or medals on those who,"
"168  of their own accord, first publish either in a magazine, a newspaper, or in a separate form, any important and useful facts on the subject. This would have encouraged and ‘stimulated extensive investigation; whereas confining rewards to a chosen few, discourages general research, and, if we may judge from all past experience of paid commissions, will end in little. A committee, composed of both scientific and practical men, might have been appointed to judge the merits of authors, and reward the deserving, whether they were claimants or not."
"As we have already enough of facts to indicate the origin of contagious matter, ! may trouble you with an article on it, of more practical tendency than the present, if you insert this; and I am, sir, yours, &c.,"

"siR—I observe in your last number a communication from "" M. H. C.,"" in which he says, that his late planted potatoes have not been injured by the disease. I have been in the habit of planting cup potatoes in June, after vetches, for the purpose of keeping them for seed; I had them dug out this week and find them small with scarcely a sound potato amongst them (say a quarter of an acre), whereas my general crop of cups was good, and few bad potatoes in them. My apple potatoes were very abundant, but about three-fourths of them are tainted, though not too bad for present use."

STORING POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, November 22""7 1845, page 491"
"siB—In looking over the statistical survey of Kildare, 1807, the account given of the late Mr. Rawson’s method of preserving seed potatoes may be acceptable to the readers of your valuable GAZETTE. I. therefore, copy it concisely, as it appears to me that in the dread of famine, the following summer, people forget how we are to procure seed for planting next spring."
"In page 149, the surveyor says that I have, for many years, been in the habit of cultivating potatoes in three feet drills with the plough; the difficulty in procuring seed in the year 1800, induced me to adopt the following:—I began, at November, to have a thin slice taken off each potato, at the end where the eyes are in a cluster,"
"ie)  as they were washed and used by my family, taking care to cut the bottom of the eye: each slice produced four, or rive eyes, which were subdivided, dried, and put in casks, with oaten chaff, from a mill, for use. In March following, they resembled small pieces of buff leather. I planted some acres of them, and, can assert, that not one failed, and their produce came in a fortnight earlier than those planted in the usual way; no more are used than would be rejected at the table, and the scheme is likely to be adopted in times of scarcity. The Carlow Farming Society deputed three of their members to inspect the crops of the country; after a minute investigation, they voted the surveyor of Kildare their gold medal, as the best cultivator of potatoes."

THE POTATO DISEASE (From the Edinburgh Advertiser.)
"Farmers Gazette, November 22""4, 1845, pages 491-492"
"Professor Johnston, and the other scientific and practical gentlemen engaged in the investigation instituted at the Highland and Agricultural Society's show, at Dumfries for the discovery of the cause of the disease in the potato, have issued - several useful hints for the preservation of the crop on hand, and have circulated queries amongst practical persons for the purpose of eliciting information to enable them to prosecute the scientific inquiry."
"In the meantime, as it is of the utmost importance that the public should not be misled as to the extent and effect of the disease, we cheerfully insert the following paper, by Professor Johnston, which has been communicated to us:—"
ARE DISEASED POTATOES UNWHOLESOME FOR FOOD ?
"Among the many exaggerations by which the public mind has been exited in regard to the disease now prevailing in the potato crop, none has caused more alarm than the statement that they were unwholesome when eaten, and had even proved fatal to pigs and cattle. Among the queries I lately addressed to practical men in various parts of the country, and to which I have received. various replies, was the following:—"
Have any cases occurred in your neighbourhood in which the use of diseased potatoes has been injurious to animal life ?
"To this question, the uniform reply has been, no. But as the public will be better satisfied by the words of the parties, themselves, from whom the answers have been received, I here subjoin a few of the replies, with the names of the"
170  parties from whom I have received them.
"AYRSHIRE, Mr. Campbell, of Craigie, have known no injury to arise from eating them."
"KIRKCUDBRIGHT, Mr. Maxwell, of Munches, None, and the diseased potatoes are being given in great quantities to pigs."" ;"
"DUMFRIES, Mr. Elliott, Hardgrave, Ecclefechan, No cases, to my knowledge, have occurred in which the use of diseased potatoes has been injurious to animal life."
"MID:LOTHIAN Mr. Girdwood, ~ Featherhall, Corstorphine, No; my horses eat 40 Ibs. each daily (steamed), and my pigs eat as: many as they please, raw. They are all healthy and thriving. I have not given any to cattle yet, but those who have done so have no bad effects."""
"LANARKSHIRE—On the contrary, all of us are giving our milch cows half-a- peck of those potatoes raw and sliced with seeds or chaff mixed, daily; and they thrive upon them, and we are also boiling them with chaff for our work horses, and no bad results. ;"
"FORFARSHIBE.—Mr. William Drurnmond, Westbank, Longforgan, by Dundee. . None; they are given to all my bestial very freely, and find them perfectly good at table after cutting off the diseased parts."
"SAME COUNTY. Mr. Robert Newton, Halliburton, by Cupar Angus. None I have heard of. :"
"These opinions, proceeding from men of high character in six of our largest counties, are enough, I hope, to allay the fears of thosé who apprehend danger from the use of unsound potatoes. They show that while in the first, or dry state of decay, the potatoes may be given to the cattle and pigs with perfect safety. :"
"The knowledge of this fact will, / think, render the loss of potatoes much less to the farmer than by many has been anticipated. If the potatoes are regularly picked, and where the supply of potatoes is large, if the picked ones only are, given to the cattle, a certain quantity of sound ones may be preserved for a much longer period than would, in all probability, be the case were those which begin to decay allowed to remain among those which are"
sound.
"Mr. Alexander, of Ballochmyle,.informs me that his diseased potatoes, when kept in a dry dark place, spread out, and at a moderate, but uniform temperature, do not get any worse. If, in addition to so preserving them, those which show any symptoms of disease are regularly picked out, and given to the stock with a little dry food. I believe, very much of the expected loss will be prevented—I am, &c.,"
"JAMES T. W. JOHNSTON, 8, Bank-street, Edinburgh, Nov. 10, 1845."
O  DISEASED POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, November 22"", 1845, page 492"
"Professor Liebig addressed a letter to a proprietor in Scotland, on the composition of diseased potatoes, in which he says: —"
"The researches I have undertaken upon the sound and diseased potatoes of the present year have disclosed to me the remarkable fact that they contain, in the sap, a considerable quantity of vegetable casein (cheese), perceptible by acids. This constituent I did not observe in my previous researches. It would thus appear that, from the influence of the weather, or, generally speaking, from atmospheric causes, a part of the albumen which prevails in the potato has been converted into vegetable casein. The great instability of the last substance is well known— hence the facility with which the potato containing it undergoes putrefaction. Any injury to health from the use of these potatoes is out of the question; and nowhere in Germany has such an effect’ been observed. In the diseased potato no solanin can be discovered. It may be of some use to call attention to the fact that diseased potatoes may easily, and at little expense, be preserved for a length of time, and afterwards, employed in various ways, by cutting them into slices of about a quarter of an inch thick, and immersing them in water, containing from two to three per cent. of sulphuric acid. After twenty-four or thirty-six hours the acid liquor may be drawn off, and all remains of it washed away by steeping in successive, portions of fresh water. Treated in this manner, the potatoes are easily dried. The pieces are white, and of little weight, can be ground into flour, and baked into bread along with the flour of wheat."
"POTATO CROP Farmers Gazette, November 22""%, 1845, page 492"
"I would earnestly recommend attention to the suggestion of the government commissioners, to make an autumnal planting of potatoes. I do this from the experience of several years. The objections with respect to frost as affecting other latitudes, apply but slightly to. our mild western climate. In the middle of October, I planted an acre of kidney potatoes, and intend to plant five more before the 1st January, of early kinds —kidneys, coppers, and black-bulls. In former years I have had by such means, on Patrick's day, potatoes of a size which would be called in London fine early potatoes, in May, or in the first day of June—full-sized kidneys of the best description. |, therefore, earnestly entreat my poor countrymen to plant at least a quarter each."
"But I differ with the commissioners as to placing the manure in contact with the seed. I would interpose a slight layer of earth in this season, when such a tendency to decomposition prevails. Care should be taken in selecting the ground, to obtain shelter against the north-east wind, and to sow in new and well drained land. What"
"172  a blessing to a peasant, to carry his family through the early summer!"
"""THE KNIGHT OF KERRY."""
"POTATO CULTURE AND DISEASE Farmers Gazette, November 29"", 1845, pages 505-506"
"- gin-—In June, 1836, I published, in the Dumfries Herald, views on the potato disease, which have been but slightly modified since. As far as I am aware, I then stood alone in the opinion that our cultivated potatoes had degenerated by improper culture, and become diseased. I trouble you with an extract or two :—"
""" Some plants are natural or indigenous in particular soils, climates, and countries. These grow in such part spontaneously. Others, though not natives of a soil, _ maybe raised on it, for a time at least, with no great expense of cultivation; but, gradually degenerate. To follow nature in the culture of potatoes, we would be much aided by a knowledge of the soil and climate where they grow spontaneously. Were scientific men to be employed to examine several of the localities where the potato grows spontaneously, and carefully to analyze both the soil and the potato, much valuable information might be got; and this might, ere long, be reduced to practice in our country."
"""By removing weeds, and applying dung and stimulants, we may so rally and concentrate the retraining strength of an exhausted soil, that it may, for a time, give nourishment to plants which it could not otherwise bear. But in this case, it will be found, before long, that the enfeebled and diseased soil has been from year to year throwing into its plants what was but ill fitted for their nourishment. Thus we may for a time raise species of diseased plants, and employ these as the seed of the next crop. Nothing can be more manifest than that the off-spring; of diseased parents will participate in their disease, and even be incapable of cure, or of becoming the seed of a healthful crop on any soil. It is evident that diseased plants may be more easily cultivated on a healthful and fresh soil than on one which is diseased and run out. But the abundance and healthfuiness of the crop are two very different things. It is well ascertained that seed potatoes, taken from, fields on the higher grounds, and where potatoes have been much seldomer cultivated, are less liable to fail than those raised on fields which have produced many potato crops. The latter forced in diseased or exhausted fields are unfit for seed in any situation."
"I did not then distinctly see the fact that a. heavy dose of any kind of dung produces a diseased crop; but I was fully aware potatoes raised with much swine’s dung had been repeatedly blamed for inducing typhus in Glasgow and, other places, and hence inferred their diseased character. The Editor suppressed this part of the article, on privately consulting a physician, I advised, as a remedy, "" to get seed as soon as convenient from those parts of America where potatoes are indigenous. Many of the families in our country seem almost reduced arid worn out."""
"O  i would not now defend every point stated in the above extracts; yet I believe we are still very ignorant of the food of plants and even if I should be esteemed "" no man at all,* I doubt whether Liebig's inorganic theory has thrown much, light on the subject. Some, in their field experiments, seem to succeed like magic. My pecuniary interest is too deeply involved for me to wish to deceive myself. My field experiments have been performed with an attention which can be exceeded by no man; yet their results have perplexed me so much that I have hitherto published almost none of them. I send you a few of those in growing potatoes in 1843."
"The soil was old croft land, of medium texture, formed from greywack, and resting on a subsoil of the same formation. Water readily passed through it. I examined it for lime by means which would easily detect 70 Ib. in an acre of the soil; yet I found not a trace. The subsoil had distinct traces of lime. The alkalies and phosphoric acid were detected, but in too minute quantities to be correctly estimated, without analyzing a very large quantity of the soil. The oxide of iron amounted to almost 10 per cent. The soil had been mostly in pasture during the present century, and was esteemed the best pasture field in this quarter. \t yielded me oats with plenty of straw, but the grain was small in quantity, and very light. Exposure very gently to the south; and, in the lower section, inclining distinctly to the east. The experiment ground was divided into two sections of lots, the one directly to the south of the other. The potatoes were the Dalquharran variety, and planted uncut, in drills 33.6 inches wide, on 1st May. In each section I shall begin at the east, and end at the west. The crop was raised on 17th November, with grapes, and weighed on the field, with a beam which indicated half-an-ounce, when each arm was loaded with about 2 cwt."
"The ground was chosen for these experiments with the closest attention, yet the soil was not altogether uniform. In the northern section, it perceptibly improved from the guano to the unmanured lot, and, on the contrary, from the easterly slope, in the southern section, the guano had the best natural soil, and the unmanured lot had the worst. The ground was not known to have ever borne potatoes till this crop."
"1. As the soil was perceptibly improving from the first to the seventh lot, the guano may have done a little good; but the dung seems doubtful: and the coal ashes and salts, used in the fifth and sixth lots, seem evidently to have hurt the crop; as while the soil was improving the crop under them was diminishing, and greatly less than when no manure was given."
"2. In the southern section, the soil distinctly improved (in depth and quality) from the fourteenth to the eighth lot. Hence it is doubtful whether the guauo did any good in the eighth lot. i think the most skilful agriculturist would esteem the soil of the eighth lot fully equal to that of the seventh; yet the seventh, without manure, bad three tons more of crop than the eighth with 5 cwt. of guano ! The bones seem to have done a trace of good. The salts manifestly did much hurt. But from the decided inferiority (and thinness) of the fourteenth lot, and yet its weight of crop, I am in much doubt whether any of the manures did any good."
A mere amateur may wonder why I had not all the lots of exactly the same value of soil. This was impossible; I could do no more than choose the most uniform part of the field in my power. The analyzed soil was taken from the seventh lot—one
"174  specimen before the crop was put in, and another after it was raised. No one who knows the /abour of one quantitative analysis, will expect that I could spare time to analyze a specimen from each lot; especially when I could expect to detect differences only in the proportions of fine and coarse matter, and in the depth of the soil. oo, :"
"‘To form a rough estimate of the comparative sizes of the potatoes from each manure, I selected six of the /argest and best formed of each lot, did not wash, but carefully wiped and weighed all."
"As it is impossible to weigh very accurately, without much time, and as the potatoes rapidly lose weight in dry air, I preferred weighing quickly so as to be sure of being always within 60 grains of the true weight."
"The potatoes of the unmanured lots were generally much larger than those from any of the manured lots. The largest tuber weighed 8288 grains. (Others in the same lot were larger than this; but these were composed of two or more grown together, or were injured in the raising. Being cut in two nearly equal halves, it appeared sound and solid. I followed out these experiments much farther than I can detail at present; but after much investigation, and two years’ reflection, I am still unable to reconcile them with any of the theories now in vogue. Those who read the Gardener's Chronicle last year, must have observed similar results recorded by the Rev. L. Vernon Harcourt, late president of the British Association. In the great majority of cases, his manures diminished his crop. On another part of the game field, in 1843, in turnips, nearly all my manures gave less crop than the unmanured lot."
"‘Now the great puzzle is how did this soil give so poor crops of oats, and yet, after the oats, give so heavy potato (and may add turnip) crops without any manure? I think it impossible to answer this inconsistency with the inorganic theory, and feel unwilling to offer even a conjecture."
"Yet it seems to show (1) that that the potato requires a specific food, of such composition ‘as is unsuited to the oat; for if the oat could have taken this food, it would have given me better crops. (2.) That whatever effect manures may ultimately have in the production of this food, it is pretty plain that in such a soil as mine, and in a season like 1843, they (guano perhaps expected) cannot produce this effect, if given at seed time, on the immediate crop; for none of my manures, coeteris paribus, gave more crop than the unmanured lots."
"I am not without hope that the researches of Dr. Mulder will, ere long, throw light on this matter. To write on this subject in the present stage of our knowledge, is little more than to show one's ignorance; yet, as some of your readers may have a curiosity, I shall add a sentence or two."
"Chemists have detected, in the soil, various double salts, having ammonia as one of their bases, and lime, or some one of the inorganic bases as the other, these being combined with an organic acid (as crenic and apocrenic acids). Various transformations and chemical changes must take place in the soil before these organic acids and their compounds can be formed. The number of organic acids and"
"O  their compounds, existing in the soil, is, perhaps, vastly greater than chemists have yet discovered. Future discoveries may find that, in ordinary conditions, many of these compounds can be but very siowly formed in the soil, and that the presence of one, in large quantity may, by its predisposing influence, militate against or retard the formation of another. Most plants have in their composition portions of oils. These oils, as far as I remember, are generally supposed to be formed in the plants; yet future investigations may show that these oils cannot be formed, but when the soil can afford certain organic compounds which predispose and contribute to their formation in the plants. I have, for five or six years, thought that the reason why some soils can bear any crop but oats, cannot be explained but on some princi- ples like the above. Every species of plant may require peculiar organic compounds (for its profitable culture); these compounds may be but slowly formed in the soil; and when the appropriate compound is deficient, the plant may be able to substitute, for a time, a less suitable compound in its place; and as animals become diseased when famine drive them to use unsuitable food, the same may be true, though more slowly in the case of plants."
"If the above ideas are in future confirmed, it may perhaps follow that ammonia in the soil performs but two general offices beneficially to the cultivator, viz., the forming the salts, or quasi-salts, above referred to, and aiding in the disintegration of the mineral matter in the soil; and hence that all excess of azotized matter above what is employed for these purposes, is hurtful, by accumulating fungi and otherwise generating poisonous compounds. It is obvious that the proportion of azotized matter which can be beneficially employed by the cultivator, must depend on the dryness of the soil and the amount of sunshine enjoyed. For a damp and clouded atmosphere tends to the rapid growth and diffusion of fungi formations, and the disease of cultivated crops (as wheat); while a dry and well sunned atmosphere, as that of Peru, quickly brings the nitrogen or the guano to the most profitable account."
"I have found red granite in the Peruvian guano, disintegrated almost to the heart: and hence infer that in warm, sunny climates, and even in our own climate, in favourable seasons, guano, though it contains little or no silica, may liberate, by disintegration, an abundance of silica for any of our crops. The same fact may apply though in a less extent, to all azotized manures. I need not add that ammonia exerts its disintegrating power in the soil, chiefly when dissolved as a. carbonate."
"Another fact:—On raising potatoes in 1842, the stems mown and the roots gathered by the harrow were mixed into a compost with peat and dung, in about equal parts of each. Another compost of peat and dung, in ‘equal parts, without haulm was next made. An equal dose of each manure was given for potatoes in spring, 1843, iu another part of the field referred to. The soil of each lot was as nearly as possible of the same value. The haulm, at carting out the manure, had quite disappeared, All was a uniform succulent mass. At that time I had worked myself so far into the theory as confidently to expect that the decayed and rotted potato stems (rich in the inorganic Matters needed by potato plants) could not fail to impr crop, in stem at least. But, instead of this, As stems from the haulm compost were unusually small and weak; and on raising and weighing two equal portion* from different parts of each lot, I found the crop /ess in each case where the haulm compost had been"
"176  used—the difference on an average of two trials, amounted to one-sixth part of the weight of the crop. As I have already exceeded due limits, I leave this fact to the cool consideration of your readers, and am, sir, Yours, &c.,"

"ON STORING POTATOES I Farmers Gazette, November 29'"", 1845, pages 505-506"
"siR—As the storage of the potato is still occupying the public attention, allow me to state the result of my plan, as published in the Mail of the 3rd instant. With a sincere desire to assist and encourage others in saving this important crop, I will restate my method, from the commencement to the present time."
"The potatoes under my charge amounted to nearly 200 tons, and principally cups which were planted in April, cultivated in the usual way, by drilling. No further notice was taken until the disease made its appearance, which was known by the dying away of the stems. As soon afterwards as circumstances would permit, I had them all ploughed out, during the dry weather in October, and carted into sheds, or other well.ventilated houses. In this state they remained, four feet deep, for ten days during which time they heated or rather sweated profusely, but they were kept moderately cool by turning. After this process they were picked carefully over, removing all earth, small, and damaged potatoes, which, up to this time, do not amount to one ton, and even those, (with few exceptions) are fit to be used."
"Almost the whole crop is now stored for the last. month in houses, five feet deep, and covered with straw. Without this covering I find the top of the heaps constantly damp in changeable weather, which shows they are still throwing off moisture, and when that moisture meets with a colder medium, it is condensed into water which rests on the straw instead of the potato. In this state they are daily improving in quality, and the disease is making no progress."
"After potatoes have been treated as I have stated it will be perfectly safe to pit them in the old way; and, as far as my judgment and experience go, it is preferable to any other. The admission of air into pits will greatly injure their quality, which is accounted for by the emission of moisture from the potatoes, and again moisture will be reabsorbed from the atmosphere. In this state the potatoes become what is termed windy, and uneatable. ."

‘oS  AUTUMN PLANTING POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, November 29"", 1845, pages 506-507"
"Sir- As both the FARMER'S GAZETTE and the government commissioners have been recommending autumn planting of potatoes as an experiment, so that every means may be tried to insure a crop next season, I send you the following experiment; and although it was only done on a small scale, I am confident that if it had been done in a more extensive way, the results would have been equally satisfactory."
"On the 28th November, 1844, I opened a drill twenty-one yards long and six inches deep, in a piece of poor garden ground, in rather an exposed situation. It had only been used as a garden the previous year, when it was trenched eighteen inches deep, and manured with a crop of vegetable refuse. I divided the drill into three equal parts of twenty-one feet each: twenty-one sets of Lumper potatoes were planted in each lot, a foot apart—"
"No. I, whole potatoes were planted on the manure;"
"No. 2, whole potatoes were planted under the manure ;"
"No. 3, cut sets, were planted under the manure, which was fresh stable dung; and when covered and finished, the sets under the manure were about seven inches below the surface, and those on the manure six inches under the surface. On the 28th of May, six sets of No. 1 had come up, eighteen of No. 2, and sixteen of No. 3; and on 17th June, the whole had come up, except two sets of No. 3, which had perished. These were made good by transplanting. I may here remark that potatoes of the same sort, and planted about the middle of April in a field, came up before those planted in the autumn; therefore there is not much to be feared from frost in the spring by planting in the autumn. On July 15 Nos. 2 and 3 were considerably stronger than No. 1 and kept ahead until they were destroyed by the frost on the 23rd September. Only a few spots of the disease were to be seen on the leaves before they were cut down, by the frost, but when the crop was taken up on the 20th November, two-thirds of the tubers were diseased; they were all weighed, and the produce was as follows :—No. 1. 3 stones 9 lIbs.; No. 2. 4 stones 5 Ibs.; and No. 3. 4 stones 9 Ibs. The last was decidedly the finest specimen of potatoes. The above was at the rate of about 30 tons per acre, which could not be expected in a field, unless in a very favourable situation."
"I always plant my potatoes under the manure in the spring; but in autumn planting I consider it doubly beneficial to do so, especially when stable dung is used, which, being a non-conductor of frost, preserves the sets without covering them too heavily with earth. By the time the stems begin to rise in spring the dung is well rotted, and, as the stems emit a tuft of roots at every eye, as they rise through the manure in which, the young roots are quit at home, by removing; a little of the earth, they are to be seen catering for nourishment in every direction, which enables the stems to rise more robust and vigorous than when planted on the manure, as in this case the young roots are united with the poor soil, and have to travel downwards a considerable journey before they can reach food to supply the stem in anything like a vigorous state."
"As sound potatoes to plant will be very scarce and dear in the spring, and, in all"
"178  probability, many of the poor cottagers will only be able to plant a very limited space for want of seed, in such cases much might be done by transplanting from wherever more than one stem comes up from a set; remove a little of the earth and slip off all the stems but the stoutest one; replace the earth and plant the stems immediately, either to make up vacancies where sets had failed, or to plant in new made drills, or beds, or manure, by themselves. If this was done when the stems were about 3 or 4 inches high, and on a clowdy day, while the ground, was moist, success would, be certain. In 1844, which was not a very favourable, year for transplanting, I transplanted part of a drill after it was rather late in the season, which produced at the rate of 10 tons 10 cwt. per acre. I have lately planted about ha {f an acre of potatoes in a. piece of stubble; all the sets were planted whole, and in ploughing the ground the sets were dropt in every third furrow. In one _half of the ground the manure was spread in the furrow over the sets, and in ‘planting the other half the manure was put into the furrow on each side of the one where the sets were; so that, in this case, the ground got a full manuring without coming into close contact with the sets. This may give them a better chance to stand the winter than those that are planted along with the manure; for indeed the potatoes which appear at present to be sound, are not much to be depended upon for seed."
"As many people are against giving diseased potatoes to horses or cattle, for the last six weeks I have been giving each of the horses, here two stones daily—one stone in the morning and another at night, in place of half their daily-allowance of oats; and although they are almost every day working a heavy subsoil-plough, they are improving in condition, and are as sleek as hunters. They get them raw, and seem to be very fond of them—-of"" course they get none that are very bad."

I caused a trial to be made on some greatly discoloured, and am now able to assert that the statement has been fully verified. Being forgotten, they remained three hours in the oven; but on cutting them through the middle, the appearance was uniformly good throughout, and in flavour not distinguishable from the sound ones. I have thought it right to make this simple communication to you, as the statement appeared so improbable that few would take the trouble of testing it; whereas the truth of it being made known to scientific men something important may be brought to light through them.—Yours, &.,"

"O  AUTUMN PLANTING POTATOES Farmers Gazette, November 29°, 1845, page 507"
"Prepare one acre of ground (as if for planting cabbage for spring) that has been well manured, and cast up in broad sets, and either cut your or scoop it; but in either case you must put in the seed as fast as you prepare it. The better way is to have the potatoes on the ground, and one set of hands cutting while the other set is putting the seod into the ground. Each set to be put into the ground with a setting stick, six or seven inches deep at the rate of twelve seed to each square foot. An acre planted in this way will require 846,720 seed, and give as many plants to transplant in spring, as will do for twelve acres."
"One acre of potato-ground, drilled at two and a half feet apart, will contain 26,860 feet in length. Every two feet will require five seed, making in the acre 67,2CO seeds, or eight barrels."
"Every farmer should know what his weekly consumption of potatoes is—so that if the farmers would, on one day in the week, scoop from each potato that is to be used for the week three eyes, and plant them us directed, he would find a great benefit resulting from this plan. He will not miss, in the eating of the potato, the seeds he has so judiciously extracted.—"
T.K. POTATO DISEASE Public Meeting in Moate
"Farmers Gazette, November 29"", 1845, page 507"
"A crowded and highly respectable meeting of the gentry, clergy, and inhabitants of the barony of Clonlonan in the county of Westmeath, was held in the court house, Moate, on Monday, the 17th of November, Denis Daly of Castle Daly, Esq., J.P., in the chair, to consider of the propriety of addressing her Majesty's government on the present prospects of the country, with regard to the state of the potato crop."
"Every part of the court house was filled almost to suffocation, and hundreds were unable io obtain admittance. On the bench were Denis Daly Esq., J.P.; Cuthbert J. Clibborn, Esq., J.P.; James Fetherstone, H. Esq.., J.P; James Clibborn, Esq., Barclay Clibborn, Esq.; Thomas Clibborn, Esq.; W. C. Clibborn, Esq.; Rev.

The necessary resolutions having been unanimously agreed to, and several appropriate and temperate speeches having been made, the following address to the head of her Majesty's ministry was adopted by the meeting :—"
"180  To the -Right Hon. Sir Robert Peel, Bart."
"siR—We,- the inhabitants of the barony of Clonlonan, in the county of Westmeath, _"
"having met this day in the court house, Moate to take into consideration the present lamentable failure of the potato crop, beg leave most respectfully to represent to you, as the head of her Majesty's government, that to our own knowledge, the disease prevails to an awful extent in this locality, threatening the destruction of more, than, one half of the food of the farming and labouring population. We, therefore, conceive that the time has arrived when her Majesty's government should adopt prompt and energetic measures for the prevention of famine and pestilence."
"It is the unanimous opinion of this meeting (.as you will perceive by the accompanying resolutions), and the general feeling among all classes _ throughout the district, ;"
"4. That corn, and every other species of food should be at once admitted, duty free. If this measure be not speedily adopted, we have reason to fear that the northern ports, from which an extensive importation of grain may be expected, will be closed, either in consequence of the approaching winter, or by the fiscal regulations of foreign powers,"
"2. That, in order to enable the labouring poor to procure the necessaries of life for themselves and their families, it is absolutely essential that her Majesty's government should make vigorous exertions for the immediate employment of the people in public works, such as drainage, reclamation of waste lands, &c., we would respectfully suggest that such Irish funds as may be at the disposal of her Majesty's. government, including the receipts of the commissioners of woods and forests, should be devoted to this object. :"
"And, in order to promote, to a more extensive degree, the employment of the industrious poor, we would most earnestly solicit that her Majesty be advised to assemble parliament at as early a period as possible, for the purpose of taking into consideration the various railway bills at present proposed for Ireland, with the view of passing such bills as may appear calculated to afford the greatest advantages to"
the country.

"POTATO DISEASE Farmers Gazette, December 6"" 1845, page 519"
"I believe I was the first that called the attention of the Irish public to the state of the potato crop in England, at a time, as I conceived, that of Ireland was safe. My object was, as I stated, to warn, lest the plague might visit our country —it did so. I often have repeated the warning, hoping I might be instrumental in doing some good. Frequently, almost in despair, seeing the ravages the disease had made,"
"©  and not knowing to what extent it would spread, I tried various experiments, the results of which I made known as soon as ascertained. Many of them were proved to be valuable by the learned professors employed by the government, as their directions (at least what have been found useful) were literally what I had previously recommended. But of what avail are our exertions if He that caused the plague did not give His all-powerful aid in arresting its progress."
"I have not addressed you or my countrymen through the press on the subject for the last month; and my reason was, I saw. about that period, an evident improve- ment in the crops — in fact the plague seemed to be stayed — the diseased potatoes not only did not get worse, but those that were sound continued so. I was anxious, before I communicated the consolatory and cheering fact, to ascertain if this decided change would continue, in order that I might in that event, announce the joyful news that the Almighty, in His mercy, had been pleased to help us in our time of need. With, I trust, a thankful heart, I am now able to tell you, and the public in general, that He has done so."
"About three weeks or a month since, potatoes were fit for human use whilst the epidemic raged — the smell when boiled, was so bad that it was sickening to draw near them, and the taste was even worse. — the same potatoes laid by or put into ventilated pits, are now as good for food as those that never were diseased. The only loss is the portion that was infected. The people are using them, and the sound part is equally good with those that had not been attacked."
"I have, in my hot-house, tried if diseased tubers would vegetate, and I have apparently healthy stalks from the sound part of diseased potatoes. What the effect may be on the next years' crop, I cannot presume to pronounce; but as I am convinced that there is an abundance of food and seed, there is no necessity of running any risk. I will not detain you further than assuring you that my firm conviction is, there will not only be enough but some to spare. Since the plague ceased, infection seems to have fled with it. I have seen bad and good put together—the bad got better, good continued sound. This practice six weeks since would have caused the destruction of all."
"Wherever precaution was taken, by ventilating the pits, or putting up in dry houses, no damage has been done. It fact it seems to me, that the epidemic having ceased the potatoes are as easily managed, and as sure of being secured, as they have been in former years."
"I was in the act of getting out between eight and nine acres of potatoes, planted in lea lands on the banks of the Blackwater; and about half the quantity were removed from the land; some were drawn off, the remainder put in small pits, and undug, when a flood higher than remembered deluged this part of the country. I gave up all as lost, as five or six feet deep of water covered them for 16 or 18 hours. As soon as I could examine them, I found, to my surprise, they were as sound as before. I do not think one additional tuber was injured."
"The potato epidemic, I believe, whilst raging, cannot be checked; but when it has ceased, common care will save not only the healthy, but restore the convalescent to health. Away then with the idea of either famine or want. The extensive breadth"
"182  of the crop sown this year, has left enough to feed, not only the people but the pigs. The oaten crop was never so abundant, nor the stacks so numerous in the haggards."
"I rejoice at the alarm sounded, for it has put all on their guard, but let it not be turned to a selfish or political purpose. Few persons if any, felt more anxiety on the subject than I did. Few if any labored more to put the facts before my fellow countrymen, often in despair, not knowing to what extent the injury might go, but always hoping for the best. I can now confidently state, that I have not the slightest apprehension of want; on the contrary, by care and attention there will be a superabundance, which will, the ensuing spring, bring a high price for exportation to these countries, which have nearly lost all —"

ON RAISING POTATOES FROM SEED
"Farmers Gazette, December 6, 1845, pages 521-522"
"FROM the numerous inquiries made by correspondents, personally, and by"
"letter, as to the mode of raising potatoes from seed, we have been induced to »"
"offer the few following remarks, which may assist those who have saved potato apples this season for experimenting with, and which may be a guide to others, in their endeavours to improve the breed of the potato."
"Those who have saved potato apples this year, and hung them up in the kitchen to dry, (as many, we have reason to know, have done,) should rather have put them into dry sand, or turf ashes, in order to rot the pulp. Whenever the apples have been gathered, a layer of sand or turf ashes should be put in the bottom of a shallow box, upon which crush out the pulp of the apple over the surface, and spread it thinly; over that put another layer of sand and seed alternately, covering up the last layer of seed with sand. It may then be put away in an airy loft to lie until the beginning of March when the sand and seed together may be sown on a warm sheltered piece of ground, if possible at the bottom of a wall facing the sun, and covered, to the depth of a quarter of an inch, with fine sifted earth. When the plants are an inch high, a wet day should be chosen, and the plants lifted carefully with a trowel, and planted nine inches apart, on well-prepared ground. If the weather be dry, and the sunshine strong after planting, they should be shaded for a few days until they have taken root. Care must be taken during summer to keep them clean, by repeated hoeings with a narrow hoe. When they have grown as long as the weather will permit, they should be lifted and stored among sand in an out-house, or cellar, where no frost can come near them. In the spring of 1847, they may be planted in drills, eighteen inches apart, and nine inches between the tubers. In 1848, they may be planted at the usual distance, and treated in the same way as potatoes generally are, when they will produce a full crop. A speedier method of raising potatoes from seed is by sowing it in a pan, or bos, in February, and placing it in a hot-bed; after the"
"ie)  potatoes are the height above mentioned, they may be pricked out into other boxes among rich light earth and again placed in the hot-bed to stand till May, when they should be placed in a cold frame for a fortnight, to harden, them before being planted out."
"We can see no good to be derived from raising potatoes from seed which has teen saved indiscriminately without previous hybridization; especially, as we believe the failure of the potato crop not to have arisen from, any organic defect in the tuber, but simply from the sudden and extraordinary transitions from heat to cold, which we have experienced throughout the whole of the past season. To raise potatoes from seed is most laudable, and ought to be encouraged, for, if hybridization be carefully performed therebis no doubt of being successful in raising new varieties; and it may be that many of these will be better than their parents. With, a view to instruct the curious in hybridization we will state, as simply as possible, how this can be accomplished:. In a potato, as well as in a number of other flowers, there are male and female parts; the male parts are called stamens—small thread-like filaments on the top of which are placed the anthers that contain the pollen, or fine dust, which fructifies the female part. The pistil stands in the middle of the stamens, and is attached to the pericarp, which is the embryo of the fruit or seed vessel. Nature has so situated these parts in flowers in which both are produced, that the fine dust is made to fall from the anthers upon the pistil, thereby causing impregnation. Varieties are produced by the wind carrying the fine dust from one flower to another, or, as is frequently the case, by bees and other winged insects. There are few who have not observed bees, when going into © their hives, covered all over with a yellow or brown dust: this is the pollen, which, when carried by them from a white to a red flower, of the same family, produces a mixed future progeny, partaking of various shades of colour between red and white."
"Hybridization can never be produced where only one kind of potato is grown, but if there be two or more kinds in the same field, those nearest each other may be crossed, and if so, will produce different varieties; but in order to be sure of this, nature may be assisted in the operation without any risk of failure. The usual means employed by art in hybridization is to select the female parent flower, which should be done immediately after it has expanded, for if left longer the dust of the male may be ripe, and will fertilize it, and render the operation futile. After having made the selection, cut away the anthers with a pair of scissors, leaving the pistil; then choose a different kind with the pollen ripe, and dust the style or top of the pistil with it; hybridization will then be certain, if the flower be covered over with a piece of thin gauze, to prevent the bees from depositing other kinds of pollen. For example, if a cup potato be selected for the female parent, after the anthers have been cut away, take flowers of the white apple potato, and dust the pollen of it upon the style of the cup; cover, as directed above, and the produce will be numerous varieties, differing in a greater or less degree from both parents, many of which are likely to be improvements."
184  THE POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, December 6°"", 1845, page 522"
"siR- May I beg, amidst all the varieties of opinions that have appeared in your excellent GAZETTE upon what really must ever be of importance in this country— the potato crop, that you will have the kindness to afford me space for a few lines- It is the general view here, at least among the best-informed that I have met, that the suggestions and allusions as to the modes of treatment appearing in your editorial articles, are now fully verified to have been correct, although some have been most decidedly at variance with the scientific bulletins of the Commission Royal."
"The blast of destruction seems to have lost its power, and we are daily rejoicing in the views of an abatement in the malady, and in a decided improvement in the diseased potatoes. One remarkable fact is that the potatoes now digging are in a far more healthy state than those that were dug in October, although the fields were contiguous and the time of planting and kinds of potatoes were the same. I had minnions, and coppers, and lumpers, in some fields near Ballybeggan, in rich stiff clay, manured with farm yard litter — I have suffered much, but in other land near Camp, west of Tralee, in bog-land and sand, the potatoes now digging are sound, without a failure. I think that had all remained undug till now, the loss would have been trifling. Dr. Halpin’s ventilating pit, is the best and surest project yet recommended for the preservation of pitted potatoes, —"

. SiIR—While almost all are tracing the potato disease down by the stalk to the.
"tubers, how is the following fact to be accounted for ? I had cups and apple potatoes planted in the same ground and at the same time in April last. Towards the close of August the stalks of the cups had all the appearance of decay, as shown generally in November, while the apple stalks remained perfectly green. Early in October the cups were dug out quite free from taint, and in fifteen days after the apples were taken up, half of them tainted at the time, and nearly all very soon became unfit for use. The stalks of the apples were fresh even when dug out, I have not observed such results in any of the numerous publications on the subject."
"I observe many of your correspondents are apprehensive of sowing wheat in ground recently occupied by diseased potatoes. In the middle of October last I dibbled in wheat in such ground, and it was beautifully up in 16 days. Seeing this, I dibbed the remainder, and it was generally up in 25 days—a single grain in each hole. The last sowing was with grain which had been steeped and limed for the first sowing, which, with the more advanced season, may account for the longer time in"

"This statement is grossly incorrect, as all those who are acquainted with the actual position of the Devon estates, must be fully aware. But I should not have thought it worth while to give it a formal contradiction, if I had not wished to take the opportunity of making a few observations upon the painful subject which has given rise to that statement; moreover, I am unwilling to take credit for an act of liberality which I have not performed, or, as others may probably view the matter, to be supposed guilty of a large and inconsiderate expenditure, ill suited to the means at my disposal."
"But whilst I repudiate the praise, or the blame, which may be bestowed upon this supposed expenditure. I am fully aware of the obligations that rests upon all persons connected with land in Ireland, to make all necessary exertions, including the requisite pecuniary sacrifices, cheerfully and promptly to assist in averting the evils of scarcity with which that country is threatened."
"I know that the trustees in whom the property of the late Earl of Devon is vested, as well as many other very excellent friends of mine in Ireland, are prepared to do this, and, are only anxious that the measures which they adopt shall be rendered as extensively useful if possible."
"The purchase of a stock of food to supply, when necessary, the scarcity of potatoes, is of course, one of the essential points to he attended to; but as I presume, that no man conceives the idea of feeding gratuitously, the whole agricultural population of Ireland, the next point, hardly second in importance is, to consider in what manner the people may obtain the means of purchasing the food so procured."
"I see no advantage in county of public meetings—in resolutions or in speeches. It is not necessary to proclaim the evil. This will make itself felt soon enough. Our business is to act, not to talk; and the more quietly we act the better. Every landowner, large or small may have the means, and assuredly ought to feel the duty of contributing his quota of usefulness as the present crisis. There is"
"186  scarcely a square mile of land in Ireland which does not call for some improvement of a nature to increase its permanent value both to landlord and tenant, and, at the same time, to add to the stock of ; human food. What a field does this offer for the employment of the people ? Let each landowner only consider what improvements maybe effected upon his own estate, and let him proceed to carry these out by which means as are within his reach. If he has capital, he cannot employ it better than to protect from want the people from whose labour his future income is to be derived, and, at the same time, to improve permanently the sources of his wealth. If his estate is heavily burdened with debts, or from other causes he has no command of capital, he has a right, upon an emergency like the present, to look for that assistance from the state of which the legislature established the principle many years ago, by the statute 1 and 2 William IV., c. 33. Other acts have since passed in the same spirit, and all founded upon the acknowledged truth — ""That greatly to improve the resources of my part of the empire, tends to the welfare of the whole. """
"The legislature, in the act referred to, proceeded with reference only to the constant and ordinary pressure arising from want of employment. With how much more force may they now be called upon to give aid towards removing the extraordinary pressure that is now impending, and to arrest the fatal consequences of an actual want of food. It will be the duty of the government to propose, and of the parliament to decide, the extent to which assistance ought now to be given, and the terms upon which it shall be granted; sure I am that terms may be arranged, advantageous alike to the landowner and the state."
"The proprietor who cannot advance the £1000 or the £5000 which the circumstances of the time calls for, may be, well able and contented to pay interest and an annual installment; and even the mortgagee or annuitant may find it to be consistent with their truest interest to make a small annual sacrifice to uphold and improve the security upon which they depend. The government have also to look to other modes of giving assistance at the present moment. Some public works may be usefully undertaken at the public cost, Many others — such as extensive drainage, for example — may be carried on under government superintendence, partly at public, partly at private cost. I will not assume that government are neglectful of this duty, because they make no extraordinary stir; on the contrary, from the constitution of the commission which they have appointed, I augur that their object is to take ‘a wide and comprehensive view of the whole subject, and to be prepared with such measures as the actual state of the country, after inquiry and examination, shall appear to call for. :"
"But whilst we look to government and to parliament for aid upon the present occasion, let us not overlook the duties and responsibilities that attach to each of us as individuals. Some circumstances at the present time are favourable to the success of the work that is now before us."
"The works upon railroads which are already in progress in Ireland, are very generally performed by the labourers of the neighbourhood; and, although the work is heavier than that to which they have been accustomed, and they were at first hardly willing to undertake it, yet, by judicious management they have in various quarters been led to apply themselves manfully to their new task, and, by taking piece-work, are enabled greatly to increase their earnings, and generally to"
O  improve their condition.
"Much praise is due to Sir John Macneill for the judgment and perseverance displayed by him in dealing with his countrymen, at their first introduction to this new kind of work. His example has been followed by others; and the same course may be adopted most usefully both in public and private works; and I am sanguine enough to believe, that if Paddy be fairly put into the right way, he will be both ready and willing to earn more money, and to get better food for himself and family, by a more energetic exertion of his bodily power than circumstances have hitherto called upon him to make."
"This visitation of Providence may teach us all some useful lessons; if we profit by them rightly, good may arise out of the present evil; and I indulge the hope that the result of the next year's exertions in Ireland may be a great and lasting improvement in that country, and a large amount of consequent advantage to the empire at large.—l remain your obedient servant, ;"
DEVON.

"The following letter was received by the Guardians of the North Dublin Union Workhouse at their usual weekly meeting, relative to the conversion of diseased potatoes to food:-"
"GENTLEMEN- The commissioners appointed by her Majesty’s government, for considering all measures connected with the failure of the potato crop are anxious to have carried on in the North Dublin Union Workhouse, in a practical and working form, a trial of the process for converting diseased potatoes into wholesome food, proposed in the 6th report of the commissioners of scientific enquiry into the state of the potato disease."
"To effect this object the co-operation of the board of guardians is requested by the commissioners. A sufficient sum of money for the cost of erection of the apparatus will be allocated to that object, and a person will be appointed by the Commissioners to superintend the details. The supply of materials (diseased potatoes), and the labour of the paupers, so far as required, it is considered the guardians can have no difficulty in contributing. Professor Kane, one of the Commissioners, has kindly consented to act along with me in the general inspection of the processes and the results, and we shall, with that object, have frequent occasion to visit the workhouse whilst the trials are being carried on."
"In this application to your board, the Commissioners have the concurrence of the Poor Law Commissioners, who look to the results of those trials for information as to the course subsequently to be followed."
"Requesting the favour of an early reply, I have the honour to be, gentlemen, your obedient servant,"

"ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF IRELAND Farmers Gazette, December 13"", 1845, pages 540-544"
"At a meeting of the council held this day, the Earl of Clancarty in the chair—the following members also present, viz: Charles Doyne, Stewart Trench, William B. Wade, Charles Roper, Sir George Hodson, Bart., Elias T. Corbally, Esquires; Right Hon. Edward Lucas, Professor Kane, Thomas Butler, Esq., Hon. C. James Trench, J. B. Bankhead, Esq., John Ross Mahoan, Esq., and Acheson Lyle, Esq., the following address to he landed proprietors of Ireland was unanimously adopted:— ;"
"Address to the landed Proprietors of Ireland, from the Council of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society- Having deeply considered the circumstances under -which this country is placed at the present moment, when, by the visitation of"
"Providence, a proportion of the ordinary food of the population has. been rendered"
"unavailable, and the means of acquiring support from other sources, may be with"
"difficulty attainable by the labouring classes, the Council of the Royal Agricultural"
"Improvement Society have felt it their duty to address to the Members of the Society,"
"and the Proprietors and Occupiers of land generally in Ireland, the following"
"observations on the means by which it is believed, that a great deal of the threatened distress may be alleviated if not prevented."
"The council feel that in putting forward to the landed proprietors of Ireland, those suggestions of the modes in which their beneficial intelligence and zeal may interpose to shield the people from the sufferings of physical want, the inevitable consequence of insufficient employment, they (the Council) but fulfill the duty which directly devolves upon them, in undertaking to conduct the affairs of a society such as that for agricultural improvement. A society in which the well being of the farmer is the greatest object, in which the interest of the largest proprietor and the smallest cottier are indissolubly bound together, in the common purpose of ameliorating the state oi husbandry in Ireland, in extending the resources of the soil, and in elevating the position of the people. The council truly feel that they but give form and substance to the feelings which animate the landed proprietors of Ireland, when they advocate the great social truth, that the owner of the soil is the natural protector and instructor of those, who, by the dispensation of Providence, depend upon him for the land by the fruits of which they live. In that position he is recognised by society and by the law, and it is from the conscientious fulfillment of the duties of that function, that the most _ honorable distinction and the purest pleasure can be derived."
"A quarter of a century ago, the country suffered under a deficiency of food, from which resulted famine and consequent disease. The active benevolence of our gentry, and of our wealthy fellow-subjects in Great Britain and the Colonies, then interposed, and although much of the exertion was misdirected, it would be ungrateful not to recognize that by the charitable intervention of the wealthier classes, the amount of suffering and destitution which fell upon the"
"O  poor, at that unhappy period, was remarkably diminished; but we should be sorry, indeed, to look forward now to any occasion for the intervention of mere charitable help. A country blessed by Providence with the vast means, as yet scarcely brought into play, for improvement in material wealth; a population showing, when circumstances are at all favourable to their development, decided intelligence and energy, should not beg; they should owe their escape from difficulties, not to the charitable pity of a hard-working, and, therefore, powerful neighbour, but to their own energies, and to the active exertions and co-operation of proprietor and occupier, of employer and of labourer on the soil."
"The Council feel it incumbent on them, in fact, to notice the injurious consequences which resulted to the temper and habits of the Irish people, from the system, of elymosynary aid adopted, with most praiseworthy intentions on former occasions. It is certain that there resulted from it an idea of assistance from abroad, without personal exertion, which has since acted most powertully to indispose the Irish peasant, from the adoption of new methods, of increased energy, or of intelligent foresight, of which his real nature is so capable, and by which his condition could be so remarkably improved."
"However, even if it were desirable to look forward to private charity, as a means of alleviating whatever distress may be produced by the diminution in the quantity of the ordinary food of the Irish people, there are circumstances which render it very unlikely, that on the present occasion, such charity can be expected. Other countries have suffered, at least as much, if not more than Ireland, and in each country the relief of its own poor must be the primary object. We must, therefore, meet whatever difficulty may exist by our own energies, each in his proper sphere; there is need for the exertion of all. The labouring and poorer classes must work to purchase food. The higher classes must exert: themselves to provide employment for the poor."
"The question is, therefore, of employment for the people."
"It is peculiarly fortunate at the present time, that the great mass of railway and other commercial enterprise, of which our country promises to be the field, should afford the means of occupying such considerable numbers. It is also to be hoped that an additional impulse shall be given by the necessity of the present period, to those operations of public works, by which the government can so efficiently extend the field of employment; at the same time that it establishes the most permanent and trustworthy basis of social order, the improvement of the country, and of the people. But the council of the Royal Agricultural Society feel that with a population so vast as the labouring class of Ireland, these two great sources of employment may not afford full means of support during the coming year, formally of those whose ordinary supply of food may be deficient, and who must look elsewhere for ‘subsistence. It is on this account that the council thus venture to appeal to the landed proprietors, members of the society, and others, for their intervention, to assist the people through this difficulty; not for charity or gift; not even for loans, or patronage, but for the exercise of that intelligence, and prudent foresight, that enterprise and skill, which they and those who act for them in business, so generally possess, and which can be employed at present in a manner so"
"190  profitable to themselves, so consistent with their station, and with what society expects from them, and so beneficial to the people. ;"
"It is ascertained by the concurrent testimony and experience of the most enlightened agriculturists, that there is in this country and climate, no obstacle so powerful to the development of the true agricultural riches of the soil, as the wetness with which the land, even in favoured districts, is constantly infiltrated. It would be here unnecessary, and indeed in addressing an agricultural body, so enlightened as the landed proprietors of Ireland, quite superfluous to describe the several ways in which moisture deteriorates the quality of the soil, abstracts its heat, and impoverishes the produce. They are facts fully established as parts of our authentic agricultural experience, and the remedy is also known. It is drainage; the removing the surplus moisture, and admitting the various agencies which mature the process of vegetation, to come into full play, and suitably reward the industry of the prudent farmer."
"Drainage is fundamental and anterior to all other agricultural improvements. You may apply the richest and most suitable manures, yet if your farm is wet and cold they are of no profit; but if the farm be brought into proper condition by judicious drainage, then are not merely artificial manures capable of yielding full returns but the natural powers of the soil are brought to life, and luxuriant crops reward the labour upon land previously branded as barren. There is uot an estate in Ireland, scarcely a farm, in which this change is not still to be effected. In every district may be seen tracts upon which labour could be thus expended with advantage, and in ail those districts are to be found masses of people who may be in want of food, or of wages to purchase food, to whom the improvement of the soil should be the natural and most important object."
"It is for the landed proprietors of Ireland to place the wants of the land and the wants of the people in suitable connection; to support the one by employing them in the improvement of the other; to provide sufficient food and shelter for the body, and to give peace and contentment to the mind of the labouring poor, whilst the interest of the landlord is effectively promoted by this most valuable improvement in the condition of his property; and thus it may be rendered evident and recognized by all, how necessarily interwoven and mutually beneficial are the relations of society, and practically exhibit the proprietor as the benefactor, the friend, and the instructor of those whom Providence has placed under his charge."
"The question of drainage improvement, however, deserves the attention of the landed proprietors, and is recommended to them by the council at the present juncture; not merely upon the grounds of beneficence and kindly intervention, but there are pecuniary advantages connected with the occupation of the people in that way, which it is of great importance that the landed proprietors of Ireland should fully appreciate. The council will, therefore, proceed briefly to consider them."
"If the present fears of a material deficiency in the amount of potatoes, available as food, be justified by the event, it is certain that a large proportion of the poorer classes must be supported by some means, other than their own, during a considerable portion of the coming year. No matter through what channel the"
"means of support may come, they must ultimately be paid for by the landed"
"O  proprietors. If the action of the poor-law be extended so as to embrace a larger amount of destitution; this must be by additional rates, for which, in the actual season of distress the land most be liable. If the government advance money, or give employment by public works, the sums advanced must be repaid, and hence must ultimately fall upon the land, and it is certainly well worth the attention of the owners of the land, whether it would not be better and cheaper to employ the poor of their estates in the improvement of those estates, under their own or their agent's guidance, than to have to support them in a poor-house, or on a dismal work, of possibly little advantage to each proprietor: and for which they may be equally chargeable."
"There is no investment now known, so absolutely profitable as the improvement of land by drainage. A manufacturer realizing 15 or 20 per cent. On the capital he embarks in trade, is considered most successful and a 100 competitors rush into the same line, and cut down his profits to the ordinary level of trade. But it is perfectly established by experience that, in every kind of circumstances, that the expense of thorough draining land is repaid by the increased produce frequently in four years and sometimes in three, under judicious management. Thus the profit becomes 25 or per cent. until the capital has been repaid. But the good is not then exhausted; the benefit to the land continues. It is certain, that to the labourer, to whom it gives employment, to the farmer to whom it gives greater produce, and more Certain returns to the capitalist and proprietor, to whom it affords the most suitable and profitable investment, and to the state, to which it gives an improved soil, and an industrious population, there is no field for enterprise so important as the drainage of the land in the present circumstances of Ireland."
"The Council are also anxious to remark, that they are fully sensible that many proprietors, and those among the most energetic and enlightened, are so circumstanced from the restrictions under which estates are held, and other monetary circumstances, the investment of capital in drainage, although highly valuable to their successors, might require upon their own part, a material sacrifice of their life income; and on the other hand, that the necessary money capital may not be in all cases immediately available. With regard to these circumstances, the Council would direct the attention of landed proprietors to the Act of Viet., passed in last session of parliament, by which any sum laid out on drainage by a person having a limited interest in the land, or bor-rowed for the purpose, may be charged on the inheritance or estate, as a charge prior to all others, except tithe commutation, and quit rent."
"In bringing the foregoing considerations under the notice of the landed proprietors and occupiers of Ireland, the Council feel that they may appear to put forward only principles and facts, already not only familiar to, and appreciated by, a great number of that body, but which have been adopted and acted upon by many noblemen and proprietors who have thereby become the sources of improvement, of comfort, and of happiness to their people, and eminently benefactors to their country. It is to extend their practice and to point out their example; it is to call out, in the present important period, the energetic co-operation of all classes attached to agriculture for the general good, that the council thought it incumbent on them to announce these principles in public, and to beseech the proprietors of land in every part of"
"192  Ireland, by the manifestation of prudent energy and cordial feeling, to benefit themselves and to employ the people."
"It is important to remark that the means which the council of the society felt it so useful to recommend, as a remunerative source of employment, have been considered also by his excellency the Lord. Lieutenant, and by her majesty's government, to be an object upon which the attention of the landed proprietors of Ireland might be beneficially fixed, and that for that object, the council has been requested by his excellency, to take charge of the allocation of a sum of £400, to be dispensed in prize?, for the most extensive and best conducted system of thorough-drainage, carried on in Ireland during the next year."
"The generous and beneficent donation of his Excellency, agreeing so fully with the views which the council has long entertained, as to the importance of"
"improvement by drainage, as useful equally to landlord and to tenant, -"
"encouraged the council to give greater definitiveness and publicity to these sentiments, and to promulgate this address to the proprietors and occupiers of land in Ireland. (Signed)"

"Mr. Bullen, the secretary, read the proceedings of the last general meeting, which were signed by the chairman."
THE POTATO DISEASE
"Since the council had last the honour of addressing the members at large, a new and unaccountable disease has affected the potato crop in this, as well as in the neighbouring countries, and much anxiety and alarm was created by a calamity as novel in its nature as it was general in its effects, while the whole agricultural community naturally looked to this society for information and advice in such an emergency."
"In approaching this subject, the council felt, however the difficulty of the question, not only from the novelty of the disease, but from the excitement that existed in the public mind, so much calculated to increase the evil by exaggerating its effect."
"When, however, it was first observed that the potato crop was seriously affected, the council took immediate steps for ascertaining two things, namely, the nature and extent of the evil, and the best mode of guarding against its effects, and of protecting the public from its consequences."
"For this purpose the local machinery of the Society was made available, and circulars were addressed to upwards of one hundred local farming societies affiliated with the central one, seeking for the best and most accurate information on the subject; while, at same time, a series of practical experiments under the directions of competent and learned men to enquire into the nature of its disease, and to suggest remedies to provide against its injurious consequences."
"The first part of this inquiry established beyond doubt the fact, that the disease existed to a greater or less extent in every county in Ireland, and that a portion of the staple food of the great bulk of the inhabitants had been already lost, and that part of the remainder was in danger. This fact, thus fully ascertained, the council lost no time in communicating to her Majesty's government, together with the result of the communications thus obtained by the council."
"It having been also intimated to the council that Professors Lindley, Playfair, and"
"Kane had been appointed by government, as a commission, to investigate the nature and extent of the disease. Every facility was given to these gentlemen in their"
"194  inquiry, and the different returns and documents received by the council on the subject were placed at their disposal."
"The council, also approving of the third report, published by the. above commissioners on the subject, applied to his Excellency for the purpose, ‘and accordingly upwards of, 12,000 copies were distributed through the medium of the local societies for the direction and information of the farming classes in the different districts."
"In order also to facilitate the manufacture of the dieased potatoes into farina or potato flour, the council allocated the sum of twenty guineas, to be applied in premiums for the best machines which should be exhibited for that purpose. Many new and ingenious specimens were brought forward on the occasion, and after a close and accurate inspection by the judges, the first prize of ten guineas was awarded to Mr. Robinson of Lisburn; the prize of five guineas to Mr. Frazer, of 53, Mary-street Dublin; and prizes of three and two guineas respectively to Mr. Dowling and Mr. Anderson, of Dublin, for the machines which they exhibited for competition."
"The council are also happy to be able to report that the best results have attended the distribution of these premiums, and that numerous good models have been thereby distributed throughout the couniry for imitation and adoption."
‘DRAINING
"The council in their anxiety to guard against the consequences of the failure in the potato crop, and to provide sufficient employment for the labouring population during the ensuing season, passed a resolution requesting the government to give increased facilities to the draining of land, and the lowering and embankment of rivers, as being of vital importance to the improvement of husbandry in this country; and accordingly a deputation waited on the chief secretary at the Castle, for that purpose, who was pleased to express his full concurrence in the plan, and to state that he would bring it under the immediate notice of her Majesty's government. ."
"The council have also to state that his Excellency the lord Lieutenant, in order to promote the system of potato-planting and thorough-draining in Ireland, and thereby to procure additional employment for the labouring population during the ensuing season, has placed the sum £500 at the disposal of the council for that purpose, £400 of it to applied in such manner as the council might advise; and the council having taken the subject into their serious consideration, and with a view to stimulate and encourage the large landed proprietors to come forward upon the present occasion and to aid and assist their tenantry in the improvements of their farms and the general drainage of the land, come to the resolution to recommend to the general meeting that the sum of £400 should be divided into 32 separate premiums to be distributed among the different counties in:Ireland for the promotion of thorough-draining upon the principles contained in the conditions of Sir Richard O'Donnell's gold medal, the competition for which was productive of so much benefit and advantage last year. With regard to the subject of planting potatoes from the original apples or seed, in pursuance of the suggestions of his Excellency, the council are fully aware of its importance, and are most anxious to carry it into effect; but they feel that the season is too far advanced, at"
"an  present, to enable the council to offer any such premiums with any reasonable hope of producing any corresponding benefit by doing so. The council, however, are of opinion that much benefit might be produced by her Majesty's government giving increased facilities to the importation of potatoes for seed from such countries as may be ascertained to have escaped the prevailing distemper."
"In concluding this, the fifth year of their exertions, the council have again to congratulate the members upon the progress the society has made in public esti- mation, and the increased interest taken by the public in its operations. This is manifest from the list of its subscribers, which, though not so numerous as last year owing to the fact of the annual cattle show harin/becn then-held in the city of Dublin, yet exhibits a great addition /fo their annual subscriptions over the preceding years, including many new and valuable contributors to the funds of the iust::"
"The council feel, however, that the present subscribers (being under 700) form but a small portion of the landed gentry of the country interested in the promotion of improved husbandry, and whose duty it is to ameliorate, by every means in their power, the social condition of their tenants, and to instruct and assist them in their efforts towards agricultural improvement. They feel confident, therefore, that the present call will be responded to, and lead to increased co-operation on the part of those whose interest it is to support the objects of the institution."

"DEC. 9th—The first annual lecture was delivered this evening in the theatre of the Royal Institution, by Dr. Lyon Playfair. The subject was the present distemper in the potato. The lecturer commenced by making some general remarks on the history of the potato, and its cultivation in this and the other countries of Europe. he also exhibited diagrams of the structure of the potato, and tables of the chemical composition of the tuber in its healthy state. He then described the nature of the changes, which took place in the potato under the influence of the disease. Much had been said and written with regard to the source of the disease, and since minute fungi were frequently found present in the decayed potato, the disease had been attributed to them as a cause. Some potatoes, apples, and other things had been inoculated with the sporules of the fungus, and these had become diseased. But if there were not some previous disease in the potato, how was it that some potatoes escaped whilst others were attacked ? The disease, he believed, arose from physical or chemical causes. It was simply a decay of the tissue of the potato, arising from the union of the tissues of the potato with the oxygen of the atmosphere. When a decayed potato was examined, it was found that the diseased spots were always found in the region of the tissue called spiral vessels, whose function it was to carry air into the tissue of the potato."
"196  The reason why the cells entered into this decomposition so rapidly arose from a constitutional weakness on the part of the cells of the tuber. This decay is rapidly - spread from one cell to another, and the looser the tissue the more rapid the decay. By grating the tissue of some sound potatoes, and exposing it to the atmosphere of the lecture-room, it speedily assumed the colour of the diseased potato. The cause of the constitutonal weakness in the cells of the tuber was undoubtedly to be looked for in the weather. A peculiar weather had been observed over the whole of the north of Europe, when the disease had been - observed, as well as in America. The disease was no new thing, and appeared always when such weather occurred. At the time the plant commenced growing there was very warm and mild weather; and this was ‘followed by cold and wet weather. The consequence was, the cellular tissue of the tuber contained more water than usual. In previous years an analyses of the potato gave on an average 72 per cent, of water, but analyses which he had made, this year, of healthy potatoes, gave from 72 to 75 per cent, of water, whilst the analyses of diseased potatoes gave as much as 80 per cent, of water. Other plants contained the same increase of water constituents, as turnips, and turnips were also affected with the same disease. Turnips were not affected so generally as potatoes, on account of their nitrogenous principles not being soluble as those of the potato were. The disease then was a ""consumption"" of the potato, arising from the decay of its particles in combination with the oxygen of the atmosphere, produced by the state of the cellular tissue, brought on by the weather. It arises from no degeneracy in the potato, and it need only to be feared from a repetition of the same circumstances. In the storing and preserving the potato one great fact should be borne in mind, and that is, that the decaying particles were capable of communicating the decay to the sound tissue. Care then should be taken that they be freely ventilated, that they are kept dry and cool, and there be absence of contact of the potatoes. He defended the directions given by the Irish commissioners for the storing and preserving the potatoes as those best adapted for obtaining the object in view in the community to which those directions were addressed. At the conclusion of the lecture, a vote of thanks to the lecturer was proposed by the Duke of Richmond, and seconded by P. Pusey, Esq."
"DEC. 10TH.—Lord Porman in the chair. Dr. Playfair commenced by stating that the object of the lecture this evening would: be to point out the mode of treating the potato for the future, and first with regard to planting. He recommended that the potato should be planted immediately for several reasons. 1st. Because there might be little left for seed in the spring. 2nd. Because potatoes planted now might be ready for use at the latter end of May, or the beginning of June. Where - economy of seed was not necessary, he thought it would be better to plant the whole tuber of the potato, than to cut it. Where economy of seed was necessary, single buds or ” eyes "" of the potato might be removed and planted, the rest of the tuber being used as food. With regard to diseased potatoes, he recommended that they should not be used for seed where sound ones could be obtained; but where these could not be got, then he advised the planting diseased potatoes rather than none at all. There was no prospect of obtaining sound potatoes from abroad for seed; and he had the permission of the late government authorities for stating that this was the result of their consular returns. If he were right in his views with regard to the nature of the disease in the potato, then no evil could arise from planting potatoes in the same soil in which they had become diseased. The fungus"
"O  theorists objected to planting potatoes in the same soil, but he had shown their theory to have no foundation in facts. He would now consider how the bad potatoes might be used, and quoted Boujean's experiments, to show that no injurious effect was produced on the system by eating them cooked. They might when boiled he safely given to animals, which would thrive on them, he described the various processes of procuring the starch which had been brought before the public, and pointed out the fact, that in procuring the starch only one of the alimentary secretions of the potato was obtained—that which assisted in keeping up the. animal heat. The nitrogenous portion is thus lost. The plan he recommended by which these last might be saved to a great extent, was to grate the potato, and pour water upon it till no more soluble matter was taken up, the remaining insoluble substance should then be dried, when it would be found an excellent meal, with which to make soups, puddings, bread, and other articles of food. He did not apprehend a scarcity of food, but he wished to point out the fact that potatoes contained a very small proportion of nutritious or nitrogenized matter, and as this was the most important constituent of a working man's diet, he had drawn up a table of the comparative expense at which various articles of food might be obtained which contained one pound of this nitrogenous matter."
"He drew attention to the importance of cultivating the Leguminosae with such plants as the potato, on account of the large quantity of nitrogen they contain. In conclusion, he hoped the present blight would direct attention to potatoes as an article of diet, and lead to a much less extensive dependence on them as food, a dependence of which they were unworthy, and in the end, this dreaded, visitation might prove a national blessing."
NATURAL HISTORY OF THE POTATO
"A Paper by Mr. Johnston, Surgeon, Lancaster, read before the Lancaster Literary Scientific and Natural History Society, Ilth December, 1845."
"Farmers Gazette, December 20°"", 1845, page 551"
"1.It is at all times a useful and interesting occupation, to investigate the various singular properties of natural productions, and their numerous uses developed by the application of science. I trust, therefore, that even so unpretending a subject as a common potato may afford to this society some suggestions, amusing and profitable at any time, but more especially interesting at the present moment, when the same calamity, befalling two countries, England and France, seems calculated to produce effects much more disastrous to the former than to the latter, owing to our want of preparatory knowledge, and consequent disregard of a new but profitable branch of rural industry."
"2.1n this country, where practical agriculture and practicble mechanics are carried to a higher degree of perfection than in any other portion of the globe, we are only able to meet an urgent and wide-spreading visitation by sorry hand-to- mouth shifts and devices. In France, on the contrary, establishments for"
"198  converting potatoes into starch, sugar, &c., have been carried on successfully for several years; until potato products have begun to be exported even to Ireland. There, men of science have not disdained to institute a diligent, conscientious, and profound study of the potato. Botanists, chemists, and mechanists, have combined their efforts to economise the various constituents of this useful production in the best manner. It is to foreigners we must now resort for first principles: and to the writings of Payen, Boussingault, and Dumas, I frankly acknowledge myself largely indebted for the materials of this paper."
"3. The potato has only been known in Europe for about 250 years; and has been extensively cultivated for a much shorter period. Yet already the first introduction of this substance belongs almost as much to fable as to history. One cause of this uncertainty seems to be, that, according to Sir Joseph Banks, the original potato, said to have been brought to Ireland by Sir Francis Drake, or Sir John Hawkins, was not our plant, but the Battata (Convolvulus Batatas), or Sweet Potato, which was used in England as a delicacy, long before the introduction of our potatoes. The manuscript minutes of the Royal Society, December 13, 1693, tell us that Sir Robert Southwell, the president, informed the Fellows, at a meeting, that his grandfather brought potatoes first into Ireland, who first had them from Sir Walter Raleigh. Gerard, in his Herbal, published in 1597, gives a figure of the Solarium tuberosum, under the name of ""Potato of Virginia"". In Johnson's edition of Gerard, dated 1633, we find a description of two species of potato: the Peruvian or Spanish, without flowers, probably the Battata—and the potato of Virginia, the roots of which, he tells us, he received from Virginia, otherwise called"
Norembega. He describes the former as ordinary and common meat among the
"Spaniards, Italians, Indians, and many other nations. Of. these roots, he says, maybe made conserves, no less toothsome, wholesome, and dainty, than of the flesh of quinces. They may serve as a ground or foundation, whereon the cunning confectioner or sugar baker may work, and frame many comfortable and delicate conserves, and restorative sweet meats. They are used to be eaten, roasted in the ashes. Some, when they be so roasted, infuse and sap them in wine; and others, --to give them greater grace in eating, do boil them with prunes, and so eat them; others dress them, being first roasted, with oil, vinegar, and salt; every man according to his own liking (p. 926). Of Gerard's second species, or Virginian potato, he says, its virtues may be referred to the common potato (Battata), being likewise a food, as also a meat for pleasure, equal in goodness and wholesomeness to the same, being either roasted in the embers, or boiled and eaten with oil, vinegar, and pepper, or dressed some other way, by the hand of a skilful cook (p. 928.) Gerard says, The Indians call this plant pappus, meaning the roots; by which name also the common potatoes (Battata) are called in those Indian countries. Johnson adds, Bauhine hath referred it to the night-shades, and calls it Solanum tuberosum esculentum. ; ; 4. The potato, according to Humboldt, (Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain, ii., 494,) has been cultivated on a large scale in Lancashire since 1684; in Scotland since 1728; and in Prussia since 1738. Dr. Black, the translator of Humboldt, dates the cultivation of potatoes in Scotland from the rebellion of 1745. The use of the potato was resisted in France by the Encyclopedists; and it was not until 1785 or 1786, that the sense and ingenuity of Parmentier, and the patronage of Louis XVI., succeeded in establishing the cultivation of this esculent, now so largely conducive to the agricultural and other industrial resources of France."
"O  5. The cultivation of the potato has now become common in New Zealand, in Japan,in the Boutan, and Bengal. Their cultivation extends from the extremity of Africa to Labrador, Iceland, and Lapland. It is a very interesting spectacle to see a plant descended from the mountains under the equator, advance towards the pole, and resist better than the cereal grainina, all the colds of the north - Humboldt, ii., 498. ; 6. When a potato is rasped over a sieve, a turbid milky fluid passes through, and there remains behind a fibrous matter. The fluid soon separates into two portions; a white-coloured powder, principally starch, subsides to the bottom, and a liquid floats above it. By taking a little trouble, we may thus resolve a potato into three principal constituents; starch, cellular tissue, or fibrous matter, and a watery fluid, holding dissolved in it various saline and other substances—the average result may be stated thus:—Water 75, dry matter 25 percent The starch of a potato being its most important ingredient, our best plan will be, in the first instance, to scrutinize this substance carefully in all its bearings; then to take the cellular tissue, the water and its contents, and investigate the influence they respectively exert upon the starch. 7. There are few objects capable of yielding more gratification to the refined observer of nature than the granules, as they are called, which constitute the fine white powder of Starch. It would be difficult to find a clearer or more pleasing instance than has been afforded by this substance, of that interchange of knowledge, of pleasure, and of social improvement, which is sure to attend every advance of science. About one hundred and twenty years ago Leeuwenhoek, the celebrated microscopical observer, noticed and observed the granules of starch. Later inquirers were baffled in their attempts to ascertain the precise nature of these granules, until after the discovery of polarized light. Biot then announced the granules of starch to be composed of layers, uniform in composition, but unequal in density, applied round a common axis. The form and size of the granules of starch have been carefully investigated by the improved microscopes of the present century; and these researches again have furnished means of detecting, and, consequently, preventing fraudulent substitution of one kind of starch for another. M. Payen, for instance, experimenting upon granules of starch, obtained directly from the plant, was surprised to find arrowroot totally different from the figure given by Kaspail. He conjectured that M. Easpail might have purchased his arrowroot at the shops; and, on further inquiry, he found the dealers in Paris were in the habit of vending the starch of a totally different plant for that of the arrowroot."
"8.To return to our potato. The granules of potato starch are larger than those of any other plant, much larger than those of wheat, or any common vegetable. We have seen that they are heavier than water, for they soon subside to the bottom; their specific gravity is 1.520. This property was very in- geniously turned to account by Sir Humphrey Davy, in this way:—The value of a potato residing in the starch and not in the water, it is always desirable to know how much water and how much starch is contained in a particular kind, when cultivated in the field, or brought for sale in large quantity. Von Thaer recommended an average potato to be sliced and weighed, then dried stove and weighed again; the difference thus gives the quantity of water in the potato. Payea adopts the more elaborate, but not more accurate process of collecting and weighing the starch. Sir Humphrey Davy, observing that starch was so much heavier than water, concluded that the best potatoes would have the highest specific gravity; his"
"200  suggestion is regularly published as a new discovery in the newspapers, from year to year. I have often repeated this experiment, and have found good mealy potatoes invariably heavier than others of the same size. The experiment requires neither scale nor weights. Just dissolve salt in water and dilute the brine until a piece of average potato will sink in it. This can be done in a glass; two other glasses, one a little stronger and the other weaker, will show the difference between one sort of potato and another very well. It is now considered desirable, by many, that new varieties of potato should be raised from the seed. If the first raised crop of little tubers were to be classed according to their specific gravity, before they were planted out, it seems very probable that those which required the strongest brine to float them, yield the finest new varieties."
"9. About 20 years ago, two French chemists (Messrs Gautier de Chaubry andCollin) ‘made known a very sin.jular and important property of starch—that it assumes a blue colour on being mixed with iodine. This test is so very delicate, that when starch is boiled in one thousand times its weight of water, the addition of iodine will produce a blue colour; so that iodine affords the best means of detecting starch, and starch again of detecting iodine. The iodine test, in this way, has contributed largely to the advance of chemical science; it has thrown light upon some very difficult questions of vegetable physiology, and has assisted in detecting, and therefore preventing, fraudulent sophistication. This test affords the best means of ascertaining the presence and quantity of iodine in salt water, sulphur in a mineral water, of ammonia in certain solutions of impurities and hardness in springs and wells. In France it is much employed to detect sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol in vinegar; an adulteration which in this country is sanctioned by law, to a limited"
"~ extent, :"
"10. It may appear superfluous to notice the distinctive properties of substances so familiar as sugar, gum, and starch. Sugar, as every gentleman knows, is easily dissolved in spirit and water, hot or cold. Gum is soluble in warm or cold water; but if you add spirit to gum-water, you spoil it; the water mixes with the spirit, and leaves the gum. This besides the taste, is the distinction between gum and sugar. Lastly, cold water, which acts so quickly and completely in dissolving sugar or gum, will not dissolve starch at all; neither is this substance soluble in spirit. To act upon starch, water must be nearly boiling hot, and when this cools, a thick paste or jelly remains, very ill adapted to circulate through the fine vessels of a plant. This indeed may be largely diluted with water, so as to be filtered through the finest paper; yet naturalists have discovered a filter still more fine, through which it cannot pass. The hyacinth we may observe growing in parlours, seeming to feed on nothing but water. Like the potato tuber, this bulb sustains within itself a store of food laid up for the future plant. M. Payen, having boiled some starch in 100 times its weight of water, poured the liquid into two glass tubes. Into one of these he introduced the fibrous rootlets of a hyacinth, the other he set aside. In about 20 hours, he saw light flakes of starch separate from the one in which the rootlets had been placed, whilst the other remained perfectly limpid. M. Payen then ascertained by the microscope, and by decisive experiments, that not a particle of starch was imbibed—though the water had been freely taken up."
"11. In fact, strange as it may seem, some distinguished chemists are of opinion that starch, as starch, cannot be dissolved in water at all, either hot or cold. It is thought that the granules, unless they are actually decomposed, resolved into gum or sugar or analogous products, only enlarge, so as to occupy more and more space in water without being really dissolved. These considerations, however, may be"
"©  waved; as, for our present purpose, it is enough to remember that cold water, at least, does not dissolve starch. Yet there is one decisive experiment that deserves to be recorded. It occurred to a philosopher to try what effect freezing would have upon the paste or jelly we have spoken of, which is formed by boiling starch in water. He found that by a violent cold below freezing, the white powder, the very starch itself was thrust, as it were, cut of the ice, and, when thawed, fell to the bottom, insoluble, as before, in cold water. We will now change the topic for a time, and ere long we shall see how important it is and how difficult, to comprehend and control this same property, the solubility of starch."
"11. The. fibrous, or cellular tissue of the potato, is the portion which contains and holds together the starch granules and the watery fluid. Formerly it was supposed that the granules adhered to the inner sides of the hollow cells, by means of what is called the hilum. But it is not so; every granule is perfectly free and floats or is bathed as it were in a small quantity of watery juice ,contained also within the cell. When a potato is boiled, all the granules swell considerably by absorbing this water, and so form a confused mass, until every cell appears to constitute a simple granule of starch. When freed from all extraneous substances, by the action of water, spirit, ether, &c., the fibrous or cellular tissue of the potato does not differ from that obtained by the same means, from flax, cotton, or saw-dust—Kendal Observer."
"ON THE NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF POTATOES Farmers Gazette, December 20'"", 1845, page 551"
"SIR—I propose to consider in these- observations a few of the assertions made, and arguments advanced, by Dr. Buckland in his paper before referred to, upon what are nutritive substances and how they act."
"Dr. Buckland refers to Liebig as having shown that one of the functions of the vegetable kingdom is to prepare the elements of flesh and blood for the use of animals, and then goes on to point out several articles of food which contribute little to that purpose, and others on the contrary which are loaded with those elements, and infers that the latter would be most proper food, and so far as a part of this and the next year are con- cerned, the sole food to be substituted for the potato. It is still a question, sub lite, how far a vegetable prepares the elements of flesh and blood for animals; that is to say what is the exact part prepared by each in the process of assimilation: there are fat oils and wax in plants, and fat in animals—albume in plants and animals, and so of other proximate principles—but we are not absolutely authorized to say that the albumen or the sugar in a plant is transferred direct and unchanged into the system of the animal becoming its albumen and, sugar, although Bousingault, Payen, and Dumas have shown the vital power of the plant in that way to be very great, and possibly it may yet be satisfactorily shown that nutrition proceeds in that manner. -we do, however, occasionally find proximate principles, as sugar, &c., present in the animal far above what exists in the vegetable food taken, and here these experiments are defective. On the other hand it may be decided that all is required from a vegetable is io furnish the elements, and the vital power will arrange them in the proximate principles required—that if the carbon, water, azote, and salts be the necessary proportion in the plant—the albumen, fibrin, and other principles will be"
"202  formed by the animal-organizing power. Now, either of those may be correct, both being supported by apparently good proofs; the words of Dr B. then should be, not that Liebig has shown, but Liebig has argued. It is the fault of too many writers not aware of the state of this chemical question, to place implicit faith in every statement and calculation set forward by that talented chemist."
"A very important practical distinction would arise, should the latter view of nutrition put forth be the true one, as in such case it would be necessary simply to ascertain, could certain plants supply all the ultimate elements requisite, and the amount could be added by increased quantity; in this way one article of diet would not rank so much inferior to another as the first view supposes; something of this kind must be the case with the potatoes and rice which are ranked by this author, and most of the Liebig school, so far below what their practical value indicates."
"Dr. B. has made two great oversights, one in classifying together natural substances, as vegetables and artificial products derived from plants, other matters being separated to obtain them. Thus we have occurring in the same sentence potatoes and rice, coupled with sugar, brandy, and beer. There is here a kind of mental confusion regarding single proximate elements, as sugar and alcohol, and a number of such principles mixed together in definite proportion constituting a vegetable. That because a single proximate principle as an article of diet is not nutritious when used alone, that therefore such principle is not nutritive when blended with others, the simple fact being, that the due admixture of many proximate principles is especially necessary to healthy digestion."
"I have already, in my former communication, shown the error of considering a potato as starch only or starch and water, but that it should be looked on as a mixture of numerous principles, some of which being in smail proportion, a larger amount of the whole plant is required as nourishment. This matter has been so ably handled by the French Commission, Majendic, Muller, and others, that it is considered as quite decided that one and the same substance, or proximate principle, may be nutritive or not, according as it is presented to the animal stomach in an isolated condition as prepared by art or blended with other principles as afforded in seeds and fruits. The other oversight is a physical one of great importance, namely, that of considering those articles of food which present the greatest amount of highly azotised principles as _ the most fitted for human food. I believe this to be a great error, and in practice liable to produce diseases of plethora and early death; it is notoriously an English error. Our author would have us subsist on peas and beans for many months, on food containing more highly azotized matter than flesh and blood, and much less water. What would be the effect of returning to this ""food of our ancestors?” increased disease and mortality such as our ancestors suffered—for, no doubt much of the increased average of life and insecurity from disease is due to our more regular, more temperate, and less animalized diet. ""Bulk,"" says Dr. Beaumont, is nearly as necessary to the articles of diet as the, nutrient principle—on this account too highly nutritive diet is just as injurious as that having an insufficient quantity of nutrition—thus when a stomach has to be filled, if it be filled with the farmer kind of food it is overtaxed, stimulated excessively, producing a feverish state of the system ultimately injurious. No doubt it is to this cause, over nutrition, must be attributed the illness of the"
"am we  children of the rich, fed on the finest wheat flour, and not to the cause assigned by Dr. B., viz.—non-nutritiousness of such food; and this is evident from the reason assigned by himself, that the flour has been deprived of its bran, which was clearly meant by nature to dilate the otherwise too-concentrated aliment. Bulk, then, is a necessary condition of all aliment, and this consideration brings the more watery articles of food on a nearer level with the drier corcalia and leguminosae. In the South Sea whalers the coarsest bread is taken, and serves to keep the crew healthier than the superfine meal. Captain Dexter brought home his ship from China, in December, 1804; he was 190 days out, and his bread was of superfine flower; on the voyage his men all sickened, and some died : his vessel had to be towed into harbour, his own crew being so weak. The owners asked Captain Dexter what was the cause of the sickness ? he replied "" the bread was too good.""The potato then, presenting bulk, and at the same time nutritive qualities, deserves a better fate than condemnation. Lest I trespass too much at present, I will return to this subject again Yours, &c."

"REMARKS ON POTATOES, &c."
"Farmers Gazette, December 20'"", 1845, pages 554-555"
"SIR—At this dead time of the year it is not improbable but the torpor which affects animals and plants is communicated to the mind through the animal portion of our present formation. I find a lassitude when I would endeavour to impart any information I may be possessed of, which I cannot do, though the thoughts may do in my mind, and the desire in my heart. I will, though feeling at present very incapable, endeavour to shake off dull sloth, and although not able to concentrate my mind on many particular subject, will, nevertheless, endeavour to provide an olla podrida, from the many agricultural subjects which come under my observation. First, in the present deplorable position of our farmers and labourers is the state of the potato crop; and is it not lamentable that Ireland alone, of all the countries which cultivate this very important vegetable, should be in a state of alarm and terror at the prospect of a famine, from the threatened loss of this crop, which is not, in the least, felt in England or Scotland, or on any part of the Continent where its general cultivation is adopted. There is something rotten in the state of Denmark, when the maintenance of an entire population is dependant on one kind of food; and I trust one good will arise from the present proof of its uncertainty, that our people will be directed and enabled to have a “pull in hand"" when this crop fails, or to have some other provision to look to, and be enabled to purchase such at all times."
"I am of opinion that a gradual deterioration has taken place either in climate, land, or in the nature of the plant itself, of late years. Some forty or fifty years ago we had no such potato as the Lumper or horse potato (only fit for pigs or cattle); the red apple potato for winter, the kidney for early, and the white-eye for harvest, were then the kinds grown in this country by rich and poor. The crops were most abundant, and the quality very fine. The red apple can only be"
"204  cultivated now in choice places, and with the greatest care; the kidney only for gentlemen's tables, as a kind of ""bon bon"", the white-eye altogether exploded, but supplied by a very good representative, the copper. At that time a failure of seed was unknown, the smallest particle grew. And I well remember a dearth of provision, I think in the year 1800, when the eyes were scooped out by a small implement; like an old-fashioned salt-spoon, the seed not larger than a marble, ‘and no failure was known and the crop being most abundant the next year, a mere drug on the hands of farmers. I remember my father's labourers having each a small lot of land, on which they grew oats; there was a kiln and a small hand-mill at his home, and each labourer used, in spring, to dry his corn and grind it, and I believe potato diet terminated in early spring, and stirabout and oatcakes were substituted during the other portion of the year,"
"I am told by old people that parsnips and beans were then much grown, and used with their potato diet at all seasons. The labourers wages were then (to 1800) sixpence per day; potatoes, the best apples, averaged sixpence per weight of twenty-one pounds, so that they were obliged to have a different food, which they grew on their own few acres."
The alarm for the potato crop is at an end in this part of the country. A good deal of
"care was taken in separating the sound from the unsound ones, and no additional deterioration has taken place; the proportion of injured has been not a little, but even these are not a total loss. The farmers and labourers are feeding pigs, cattle, and horses, and they use them themselves; and though there is more waste on the table than from sound potatoes, still all refuse is thrown to the pigs and cattle, and they are found to improve on them as well as when perfectly sound were used. The most approved plan is to throw away the first water when it boils, and then finish the cooking with a second water. Pigs have been bought in in quantities to consume them quickly, lest they may deteriorate too much; and those which would have gone to market are kept over for more feeding; hence the very high price of pigs meat at market. But I fear there will be a disappointment of price when the damaged potatoes are used, as all must then sell, the markets will be glutted, and the price consequently fall. !f this view is correct, it would be better for such as have them in sufficient condition to sell while the markets are high, and as no additional deterioration is going on, not to waste the damaged potatoes on hands, but use them as at present, though with a less wasteful hand. The present fear is for seed for next year. I must say, I have little or no fear, if proper care be taken; and that care should be, to move the potatoes twice in the year into new pits, to prevent them growing; or, if in house, to turn them constantly; to plant whole potatoes, and have the crop down before the latter end of April."
"In my own case, I had scarcely a damaged potato. Those planted in April, whole, were the lumpers, or horse potato, black minion or crow potato, apples, Rohan, white and purple kidneys. I never had potatoes of finer quality, or a more abundant crop. A few lumpers and purple potatoes, planted in May, on half an acre which I had trenched two feet deep and abundantly manured, planted whole, were deficient in quality and partially injured, though less so than the general crop of the country."
The plan which I know was successful in former days was as follows :—.first there
"oO  was abundance of the by cattle fed in the best manner; horses with a full allowance of hay and oats, and plentifully bedded ; sheep and cows by day on full pasture in a field called waste grass, that is a field fed till June and then let alone till December, when the cattle were put in it, and at night abundant feeding on hay, sheep the same, all kept in at night; no mixture of earth. The field for potatoes was always one kept in grass for seven or eight years, ploughed into beds; and it was not planted completely until the middle of May. Earth was put up from the trenches three times during the year, and the crop taken out in the month of November and even then the stalk was green and full of sap. The crop at once put into the house; and, after the commencement of spring, frequently turned. The sets were cut always from the large, never from the small potato. The kinds, in consequence, never degenerated; and I believe the red apple, cultivated by my father 45 years since, are still in their original perfection, in the possession of a relative who has followed up his plan. The reasons which appear to me to have been the cause of success and never a failure, were, seed from the large potato, the crop kept on a dry floor, and, by turning, never allowed to lose, their strength in vegetating, planted on old ground in good heart, and manured with dung made in perfection."
"The mode of planting potatoes in drill would interfere with this plan, but they might be planted in land of similar quality, by ploughing lea-land with a double furrow, or trench-ploughing, the first sod being very light; this being done very early, and in spring, a second trench-ploughing and good harrowing might be given. We have had many meetings in different localities-many opinions given—a great deal -written on the subject-government employers—professors to make reports and give instructions; but though done with the best intentions, ! believe it has all been like a failing merchant flying kites through the bank to keep the evil day as distant as possible, or like washing the Blackamoor white—labour thrown away, or ""Nero fiddling while Rome was on fire."" In a case of so much vital importance as the sustenance of 9,000,000 of people, all of whom are deeply, personally interested, and 4,000,000 of whom depend altogether on this crop for existence, now, that its uncertainty has been too often proved, something else must be done to enable the people to have some other provision to look to, and to put them on a par with the inhabitants of other countries who are not dependent on it. I will endeavour to point out what would tend to this most desirable object; and if carried out to the full, would effectually accomplish it; and if I can prove this, which I trust being able to do, we may look, without fear or alarm, to an increase of population for future years, propor-tionable to what has resulted in the past, where, within the memory of the lately-deceased Lord Carbery, the population increased from 3,000,000, which was, in his youth, the sum of the population when he stated we were then an importing country, to the present time, when we are 9,000,000, and exporting provisions of all kinds to a very great extent. _ I will confine myself to two principle subjects, -which will be "" the burthen of my song"" in my next letter—Yours, &c.,"

"206  POTATO DISEASE Farmers Gazette, December 20'"", 1845, pages 554-555"
"Sir- I observed in your GAZETTE of the 6th instant, an article on the Potato Disease, by Mr. Dillon Croker, together with a few additional remarks by yourself. I am sorry that my experience on this subject leads me to conclusions so widely different from those of Mr. Croker."
"One of his statements is—About three weeks or a month since, potatoes were unfit for human use, whilst the epidemic raged—the smell, when boiled, was so bad, that it was sickening to draw near them, and the taste was ever worse. The same potatoes laid by or put into ventilated pits, are now as good for food as those that never were diseased. The only loss is the portion that was infected. The people are using them, and the sound part is equally good with those that had not been attacked. Now, from this statement it appears that diseased potatoes, treated as he has described,’ are now as good for food as those that never were diseased. For the sake of my fellow- farmers and for the sake of the labouring cottager, I wish from my heart that this statement was correct: I have known of potatoes, apparently sound, having been dried, put into houses, turned, and hand-picked, mixed with mill-dust &c., and that, not withstanding all this care, went rapidly into decay, and in a ',few weeks' time, the greater par were unfit for food. _ It is generally admitted, that in dry land, potatoes can be kept more safely from the destructive influence of this disease in ridges, than in either pit or houses; yet I know a farmer who had potatoes in ridges, that were very little injured a month since, one half of which are now useless. Whether this is consistent with Mr. C's assumption that the epidemic has ceased, leave your readers to determine. :"
"Mr. Croker speaks of having "" seen bad and good put together, the bad got better, the good continuing sound; and asserts that ""common care will save not only the healthy, hut restore the convalescent to health."" How glad would the northern cottager be to have this realized. After pretty extensive enquiry, I do not know of one single instance of such restoration, but I know of instances of pretty extensive farmers who have no more than what will be sufficient for their own families (and ver sparingly used) for six or eight weeks; and I could refer to many cases of cottagers who had enough for the use of their own families, who have been obliged to subsist on a miserable diet for some time past, all their potatoes that were unfit for use being completely exhausted. Yet, in the face of this, Mr. Croker exclaims—"" Away, then, with the idea of either famine or want"". With thankfulness I can confidently state, that I have not the slightest apprehension of want; on the contrary, by care and attention there will be a superabundance, which will, the ensuing spring, bring a high price for exportation to these countries who have nearly lost all. Now I wish to ask Mr. Croker—1st, What countries have nearly lost all, and how they have lost?—2nd, What is the cause of these requiring such a supply ? When these questions are answered I will enter a little farther into the consideration of Mr. Croker's statements."
"Mr. Croker states that ""Few persons, if any, felt more anxiety on the subject than |"
"did."" This I do not dispute, but he continues—""Few, if any, laboured more to lay acts before my fellow-countrymen.” Now, Mr. Editor, have no other object than to"
"O  set the public right on this important subject, and beg to say that however true Mr. Croker's statements, above referred to, may be, with regard to the district with which he is acquainted, they could be regarded by the humblest cottager in this part of the country as the vagaries of a wild imagination. The unanimous opinion of a number of intelligent gentlemen, appointed to make inquiries in this neighbourhood, by order of the Lord Lieutenant is, that three-fourths of the potato crop are destroyed, and the one-fourth which remains are going rapidly to corruption."
"Were the subject not a very serious one, a person might sometimes be amused at reading the statements or noblemen, public writers, journalists, &c. For instance. Lord Devon (in a letter in the same number) is not so sceptical as Mr.Croker. His lordship admits, that it is not necessary to proclaim the evil. This will make itself felt soon enough. And he proceeds to give several advices on the subject; but his principal advice to ""Paddy"" is a more energetic exertion of his bodily power, than circumstances have hitherto called upon him to make. When I read this, I thought of the Marquis of Conyngham and his Donegal tenantry; and of the thousands who exert themselves to the utmost every season in the raising of crops, and retain ""very little to themselves but a part of the potatoes, being obliged to dispose of all the rest to pay the rent to heir landlords, I thought of the thousands of Irishmen, who every season assist in cutting down the harvest in England and Scotland, and bring home their earnings safe, and give it to their landlords; and when I was thinking of this,. I was struck with the similarity between Lord Devon's statement and that of a certain monarch in ancient times, who, in answer to the murmurs of his bondmen, said, "" Ye are idle,"" &c.,"
"But I would beg leave to ask Lord Devon, what motive have farmers to exert themselves so energetically in the ensuing season ? It is well known that the potato crop is one that is cultivated at a great expense to the farmer, and was the principal means by which many were enabled to pay their rents. After all their exertions this season, the hopes of many are blasted, their toil unrequited, and their means of paying rent utterly annihilated. What encouragement have they, to attempt the cultivation of a similar crop next season ?"
"Mr. Croker, however, takes a different method. When Paddy, who lives almost entirely on potatoes, comes forward to complain of want and destitution, and states, that he has scarcely a potato to subsist upon, Mr. Croker makes answer, ""I can now confidently state, that I have not the slightest apprehension of want; on the contrary, by care and attention, there will be a superabundance,"" &c."
"Lord Devon, very justly remarks that "" This visitation of Providence, may teach us all"
"some useful lessons; if we profit by them rightly, good may arise out of the present evil."""
"Though the present visitation may teach such lessons, few seem to be willing to learn them. Some, indeed, have learned, and I would be glad to hear of others, Lord Devon included, learning the same, and following their example. As instances: Mr. Shirley, of Loughfea Castle, Carrickmacross, has offered three pence per stone to all his labourers for their potatoes, good and bad, grown on his extensive estate in the County of Monaghan; and James J. Taylor, Esq., of Swords House, has nobly remitted the entire rent of all the ground in which potatoes had been planted on his"
"208  own Ministown estate, in consequence of the rot. Hoping that many landlords will take the same view of the case, and sympathize with their overburdened tenantry, |"
"remain, &c."

"ON THE MANAGEMENT OF POTATOES © Farmers Gazette, December 20, 1845, pages 555-556"
"siIR—A few plain, practical directions on the management of the potato at the present period may be of some use to those who, owing to the many conflicting opinions that have been sent forth to the public, know not in which to place confidence, or which to adopt; and which have had the effect of diverting the public mind from what I consider a very important consideration, namely— the securing a good prospect for the ensuing crop. I purpose, in the following suggestions, to confine myself to the following points, viz., the preparation of the ground for sets; securing a sufficient supply of healthy sets; diminishing the length of time that usually elapses before the new crop is ready for use; attending more particularly than has been heretofore done to growing potatoes intended for seed the following year; raising new and improved varieties from the berry or seed; best way to manage potatoes intended for seed, from the time they are lifted until they are planted again ; and suggestions as to the best way of disposing the sum of £100, given by the government, for the encouragement of raising new varieties from seed."
"In the first place, the preparation of the ground intended for potatoes is a point that has not heretofore been attended to as it ought to have been. It has not unfrequently been the case, that the preparation of the ground was never thought of until the season arrived for committing the sets to the seed-bed; and also that the manure in most cases was applied in such a way as to be injurious rather than beneficial to the crop, namely—by being placed in immediate contact with the sets. The manure, in decomposing, must necessarily communicate the same disposition to the potatoes placed in contact with it. It cannot but have been observed by all those who have paid attention to the subject, that in every case in which the sets were placed in contact with strong, undecomposed manure, they were found"
"completely rotten when examined and lifted, a thing not usually the ease. It must |"
"also have struck every observer, that where but little manure was used, and particularly if it had been well decomposed previously, and the ground lately broken up, the disease had made comparatively little progress; whereas, on rich, highly-manured ground, particularly that which had been under cultivation for a series of years, the disease has presented a more fatal appearance, and effects considerably more mischief. To avoid these casualties in future, the plan I would recommend to be adopted is, to set about the preparation of the ground as soon as possible in the autumn, and either dig or plough the manure into the ground. By this means, the manure will have had time to ferment and decompose before the potatoes are planted, and the ground, being early thrown and exposed to the winter's frost, will be finely pulverized before the season arrives for planting. The manure being regularly mixed with the soil, will not come in contact with the sets"
"O  when first put down; and the roots of the plants will be encouraged to penetrate to a greater distance in the ground in quest of food, and will meet with it in whatever direction they go. It may not be amiss to remark here, that it is at the extremity of the roots all plants take in their nourishment, and not immediately about or near the trunk or stem of the plant. By this reasoning, it will appear that the oid way of applying manure was not the best, as it was too much concentrated in one place, and the roots, soon getting beyond it, could not derive much further benefit from it; and, remaining constantly about the set, the latter soon begins to rot; this tendency being first communicated to the roots of the plants, and lastly to the tubers—particularly in a wet, dull season, such as the past has been."
"The next point for consideration is one of the greatest importance at the present moment; viz., securing a sufficient number of sets for the ensuing crop. It jis, however, fortunate, that the smaller, or middle-sized potatoes are generally free from disease, and these, if taken proper care of, will make very good seed for one year, as they may be considered in the light of abortive tubers, and will continue to degenerate from year to year. A good plan would be, to take a set or two of the rose end of all potatoes, before they are boiled for table, and let them be dusted over with quick-lime, to absorb and dry up the moisture and form a kind of coating over the wounded part, and thus prevent the waste of the sap. Let them, as they are collected from day to day in this way, be put in a cool place and mixed with dry peat-earth or sand until planted. By this means a considerable quantity of the very best sets may be secured without diminishing the quantity of food much. These sets, taken from the rose end of the potato, always produce more healthy and vigorous buds, and will be a fortnight earlier than those taken from the dry or root end. The reason is, the rose end is the last part of the potato which has been produced; and is, therefore, younger, and contains a greater quantity of sap. Another good plan to increase the number of sets would be, to start the potatoes on a hotbed until all the buds hac pushed three or four inches high. They might then be lifted and cut in the usual way; and it would be found, that in many cases two or three strong buds would have pushed from some of the eyes. These will by this time have formed roots enough, and may be carefully separated from the sets, leaving one bud attached to each The buds so separated may be carefully planted out in rows, close together, in the same hotbed which was used for starting the potatoes at first, and be kept there until they become well established, when they may be planted out for good, in the usual way. Thus, the sets may he increased in number three-fold, with the greatest ease but as all have not the convenience of hotbeds and glass covers, it is for the gentry and landlords to adopt """" plan, so as tc be able to supply their poor tenants neighbours with a sufficient stock of plants in spring, should they require them."
"The third point for consideration is one well deserving the attention of those who wish well to their fellow-man, and to the kingdom at large, by shortening- the period that usually elapses before the new crop is ready for use. To accomplish this very desirable end we must chiefly look to the early varieties, such as the ashleaved kidney, the American early, the early cruffle, the Bangor, and pink-eye. To have these choice varieties as early as possible, the plan I would recommend to adopt s, about the beginning of January, let a sufficient quantity of horse, or stable manure, be thrown in a heap, recently turned, and well mixed, in order to induce germination. When this is done, let the manure be made into square beds, so as"
"210  to fit frames with glass lights, and to the height of from 2 to 3 feet at the back, and from 1J to 2 feet at the front, thus giving it a sufficient fall to throw off the rain. The situation should be towards the south or south-east; let it remain for eight or ten days, to allow all the incipient vapour to escape; after which, let three or four inches in depth of ne earth be spread over it, and the potatoes placed lose together on the surface, and covered with two or three inches of earth. The glass- lights are then to be placed on the frames, and covered at night with bass-mats, and a little air given occasionally to carry off any vapour that may generate in the frame. By the beginning of February, the buds will begin to make their appearance, when plenty of air should be given to strengthen them, as they progress in growth. By the Beginning of March, the shoots will have grown to the length of three or four inches. The potatoes can now be lifted, and divided into sets, as before recommended; and should more than one bud have pushed from an eye, all the extra ones should be removed carefully, leaving the strongest still attached to the set; and those first taken off, return to the bed as before recommended."
"The sets should be planted out forthwith, taking the greatest care not to break or injure the buds. An opening should be made like a drill to receive them; and in planting them, they should be placed as deep in the ground, that the tops of the buds may be covered to the depth of two or three inches, with a view to protect them from the frost. By the middle of April, they will have pushed over ground, when a little earth should be drawn to the sides, and partly over them, to protect them from frost, should it still be apprehended. By this means, a good crop of potatoes may be grown, which will be ready for use about the middle or latter end of May, particularly if the ash-leaved kidney variety be treated thus. At this time a second crop of some of the late kinds may be planted between the rows of the early ones, and the earth be removed from about the sides of the early variety, so as to expose them, and allow you to remove the potatoes now ready for use. A sufficient quantity from the rows of the early variety can now be spared to cover the second crop, placed between the rows of early ones ; and care should be taken in removing the earth from the sides of the early sorts, in taking up the crop, that the roots of the early plants are not disturbed; as, if their stalks are carefully laid down on one side, keeping them in a straight line, as the row had been before, and covered with earth to a greater distance up the stalks than they had been before."
"A second crop, more abundant than the first, may be obtained from these early plants, and that, in the extraordinary short space of three weeks or a mouth at most from the time the first crop was taken up; and this crop will serve infinitely better for seed the second year, than the first would have done. By this plan it will appear that not only two, but even three crops of potatoes may be had off the same portion of ground. A second crop of the early sort will be ready to take up in July, when the plants of the early variety may be removed altogether, and leave the ground entirely to the late crop, which had been planted between the rows of the early crop in May."
"The above is no theory, for I have myself been in the habit of adopting it for the last five years successfully. When the second crop of the early varieties are taken up in July, being intended for seed, they should be spread out upon the ground, until they become green with the sun."

NATURAL HISTORY OF THE POTATO (Continued from page 551)
"Farmers Gazette, December 20"", 1845, pages 566-567"
"13. The watery juice of the potato is very complex. We learn from Payen that it contains three azotizcd substances—one soluble both in water a::-I alcohol, one analogous to albumen, and a third to caseum. Albumen and caseum are both animalized matters, the types of which are white of egg and cheese—hence the names. Many newspapers arc now trumpeting a letter from the illustrious Liebig, who professes to have discovered caseum in decaying potatoes. The fact of the existence of this compound in all potatoes, has been established some years. Liebig's announcement, therefore, adds nothing to our knowledge of the potato failure, its cause, or remedy. In addition to the three azotized or animalized substances just referred to, chemists have noticed two colouring principles, one of which is manifested under the influence of ammonia; a bitter principle, resin, an essential oil, something like fat, something like wax- asparagine, solanine, chlorophylle, phosphoric acid, citric acid, sulphuric acid, potash, lime, and silica. To the solanine and asparagine a recent author has attempted to add potatoine. i, a wearisome catalogue; yet some very obvious inferences are deducible from it. /"
"14. The anamalized substances—albuminous and caseous—though existing in very moderate quantity, and in such a state of combination as to preclude all hopes of our obtaining cheese or eggs from the juice, must, doubtless, conduce, in some degree, to the digestibility and nutritive qualities of the potato. The solanine is certainly deleterious, and the essential oil very disagreeable, both to the smell and taste, both, however, are annihilated by a boiling heat in the presence of the other ingredients. The solaniue exists only in the sprouts of the germinating tuber. Many instances are recorded of disease induced by giving sprouted potatoes to domestic animals, in a raw state. The colouring matters are rather singular. The juice of the potato is free from colour, so long is it is confined to its proper place— the cells of the tuber; but whenever the tuber is bruised, or whenever the potato juice is exposed to the air, it assumes a dark colour; and this colour, as we have learned above, is heightened by the presence of ammonia — in other words, by the process of decomposition. ~"
"15. When, in the process of manufacture potatoes are rasped and washed to"
"separate the starch, the waste water must be; disposed of. This water, from the"
"presence of the animalized matters already described, become very offensive"
and deleterious; so as to render a starch manufactory quite a nuisance. The injury
"to fish, in rivers, and other annoyances, from these establishments, were so"
"numerous, that it became an usual practice for manufacturers to sink wells, at"
"considerable expense, down to some bed of sand, or gravel, in order to get rid of"
"the waste water. At length, it occurred to someone, to try what effect the liquid"
would produce upon the land; and the result has been found very satisfactory. In
"like manner the water used for steeping hemp and flax, containing, like potato"
"water, saline and other matter, which must enrich the soil, has been most wisely"
"212  _ and beneficially restored to the fields; so that when only the fibrous matter of flax, or hemp and the starch of the potato are really abstracted from the soil, everything else being restored, these valuable agricultural products may be obtained in greater quantities, and to more advantage, than would other, wise be possible."
"16 Potatoes of themselves, are but very indifferent food, even for cattle. Their principal constituent is the starch. This, under the form of arrow-root, sago, tapioca, &e., is a common mess for sick people, and may do very well so long as no food is required except for the maintenance of animal heat, by respiration It affords nothing to. supply the wear and tear of the animal frame—nothing to maintain the growth of a child, or the vigour of a labouring man. The potato is more nutritive than starch or arrow-root, but the whole potato, and nothing but the potato, will not do. Experiments with, the potato for fattening animals, are not attended with satisfactory results; but it must be admitted that no animal will thrive on one kind of food alone. The feeding of unfortunate dogs upon sugar, gelatine, and such matters, is an useless piece of cruelty; and it does not prove all that has been inferred from the trials. It is found that human beings cannot even digest potatoes, without the addition of aninialized food in some form or other. Perhaps a diet of potatoes and milk is the lowest upon which mankind can be brought to subsist, and that is insufficient for a working man. On the other hand, the bulk of mankind eat not merely for sustenance, but pleasure; and consume more animal food than they require. To these, potatoes are at once, toothsome and wholesome, to use the words of Gerard. ;"
"47. These animalized substances, which render the starch of the potato more, digestible, and a very peculiar matter (diastase) to be described hereafter, are most abundant near the skin of the potato. Hence it is the most economical way to boil or steam the potatoes in their ""jackets,"" to use a common phrase; this is, more especially, the case as the season advances; when a portion of starch is gradually converted into sugar. The same sort of potato which yields 17 per cent, or more of starch in October, will not yield 15 per cent, in April. The manufacturers of starch have proved this by experiment, it does not appear that they bare taken the, trouble of ascertaining the increased proportion of sugar, resulting from the metamorphosis of the starch; but of that fact there can exist no doubt."
"18. Starch is obtained from the potato, as already stated (6), by a very simple process. The tubers are first washed, then rasped; the rasped pulp is strained, the starch is allowed to subside, and washed again; iti s then cautiously dried, and is ready for sale or domestic use. The operations of washing and rasping are best performed by simple machinery. I am obliged to Mr. Roper for the plan of a starch machine, taken from M. Payen. It explains itself sufficiently. English ingenuity will not fail to perfect machines of this kind to be used on a large or small scale, whenever the various applications of starch shall become generally known and practicable. Starch thus obtained may be preserved for any length of time. It undergoes no change from exposure to the air in any climate. The extraction of starch from the potato is little attended to in this country. The quantity manufactured in France, was, in 1840, about 12,000,000 kilogrammes or 12,000 tons. The tubers which ripen soonest are the best for this manufacture. Preference is given to those which on trial are found to contain least water. They are the most productive and keep the longest. It is a great recommendation to this branch of industry, that it furnishes employment to the agriculturists at the dead season of _ the year. It has been stated (17), that the proportion of starch diminishes as the"
"O  season advances— ihat a tuber yielding 17 per cent, of starch in October, yields less than 15 in April. This is a serious loss to the manufacturer, and compels him to complete his operations as soon as he can on the approach of winter. The cost of converting potatoes into starch by machinery on a farm, is stated as follows, in francs or shillings. Cost of potatoes 300; expense of labour 179-479. The starch sells for 502, the pulp for 32-536; profit 56. About 13.5 tons can be worked up in a day and produce 2.5 tons of starch. On a large scale the profit is greater. Potatoes 780, expense 355. Product, starch 1322, pulp 76-1388. Profit 175. The quantity of commercial starch obtained is about 17 per cent. 19.The pulp is disposed of in various ways. It is usually subjected to a press in the first instance, to discharge the interposed water; otherwise it would soon become injurious to the animals fed upon it. It requires to be given sparingly, only in conjunction with other food. It is soon spoiled by being kept. It is sometimes dried and ground. After the potatoes have begun to sprout, the pulp is unwholesome (14). 20. Attempts have been made repeatedly to bake starch into bread. It is easy to understand how these have failed. Wheat flour contains 12 percent, of gluten, an azotized or animalized substance, which contributes to fermentation as well as to the flavour and nutritive property of wheaten bread. 100 parts of good flour yield 180, or sometimes 150 of bread. Starch, on the other hand, contains no gluten, no animalized matter (10) ;100 parts yield only 105, or, at most 110 of bread. Boiled potatoes are more economical substitutes than starch, for some part of the flour in bread; but a well-boiled potato is a little loaf in itself. The Parisian bakers can add 15 to 20 per cent, of starch to flour without detection; a larger quantity communicates a flavour which soon disgusts the consumer. Potatoes pared, steamed, dried, and ground in a mill, yield a substance called polenta. This small manufacture doubles the price of potatoes before they leave the hands of the first operator; and the price is again doubled before it reaches the consumer, who, after all, can purchase for sixpence, as much polenta as, boiled in water, makes 16 potages, or basins of hasty pudding. 21.Starch may be considered a sort of intermediate or prospective material, fabricated, moulded, and set aside by the last act of vegetation, to serve as food for a future plant. It is not yet formed in any young vegetable organ, neither the outer rind, nor the circulating vessels, nor the spongioles, of the rootlets contain it. It is collected in cells, in the midst of those tissues where it can remain in store, unchanged until it be required as a material for subsequent growth, or a successive race. 22. At the moment when the storehouse requires to be set open, an agent appears on the spot, ready for the office. This agent is termed by chemists diastase. For rendering starch soluble in water, this substance is endued with surpassing energy; but it is neutral and powerless in relation to all other natural productions. Diastase exists in malt but not in barley, the process of malting is, in other words, the calling of disastase into operation—neither more nor less. |The chemist cannot obtain the smallest fragment of it from grain. With all his acids, his alkalies, and his ample apparatus, neither by heat, galvanism, electricity, nor any other device, can he compound a particle of disastase. He must go to the maltster, _or repair directly to the laboratory of the Great Chemist, he may sow his grain, and wait until it sprout—he can then obtain this very remarkable substance. But our affair is with the potato. There is no diastase in the shoots, there is none in the roots, only in the tuber, close to the young sprouts, and round about them,, exactly"
"214  in the very place where it is required to dissolve the starch. Yet even here it is not to be found in the potato, any more than in grain, until germination commences. The power, the place, the time, are so admirably and exclusively adjusted to one definite object, that the most frigid observer cannot but acknowledge here the proof of design. -Berzelius, indeed, hints a doubt as to the influence of diastase in the living vegetable, because he found its action upon starch in a laboratory to require a definite and rather elevated temperature (24). The fact, however, is, that in the process of malting, there is observed a marked increase of heat; and when we consider the very minute point where the process is going on within every little grain, we may easily conceive that there the degree of heat may be very considerable, and yet not more manifest to the thermometer than it is actually found. Nor must we forget that the germinating seed or tuber exercises a vital power, as inimitable, as incompreheable to the chemist. It not only employs but compounds the only substance that is wanted for one certain use, and for no other. More recently, however, chemists have succeeded in effecting the metamorphosis of starch by means of diastase, at a temperature even below the freezing point (24). 23. Diastase is something like gum; it can be dissolved in cold water, and afterwards separated by strong spirit. The water leaves the diastase, as it leaves gum (10), and unites with the: spirit. In this way diastase can be obtained at some expense, and its singular properties can be examined. Malt is the substance that yields this product most abundantly. Therefore, the properties of diastase belong also to malt. ;"
"24. If starch be rubbed up with cold water, and a small quantity of diastase, then gradually warmed, the starch is rapidly dissolved, without forming a paste or jelly, and on being tested with iodine (9), no longer affords a blue. It has exchanged the properties of starch for those of gum, and goes on rapidly acquiring a sweet taste, and the properties of syrup or of sugar. A thin jelly of starch is very quickly transformed in this way:—about 150 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer is the most efficient heat for these experiments; but by adjusting the proportion of diastase, and taking very great trouble to prepare it fresh and pore, the change of starch into more soluble substances can be effected with less and less degrees of heat, until, as has been already observed (22), a philosopher (M. Dubrenfaut) witnessed the surprising result, thatt diastase, which is neither acid nor alkaline, could dissolve a paste of starch, and convert it rapidly into sugar, at the freezing point. At a still lower degree of heat, the paste was melted, but no sugar was formed, only Dextrine."
"25.25. Dextrine, chemically speaking, is a substance like gum in appearance, obtained from starch by the agency of diastase. It derives its name from a property observed by Biot, of deflecting light to the right hand, when placed in a polarizing apparatus. It is something between starch and sugar. In elementary composition is believed to contain less carbon than starch, but more than sugar. Starch, gum, dextrine, sugar, fibrous or cellular tissue, can all be resolved by chemistry into charcoal and water. By vegetation, charcoal and water are converted into cellular tissue, gum, starch and many other products. The plant puts these elements together; the chemist separates them—that is and will ever remain the distinction between nature and art."
"26. Dextrine is similar in its properties to gum; on this account it is very useful in the arts, and has become an article of commerce under various names. For many purposes it is preferred by manufacturers to starch paste, gum arabic, or anything possessing similar properties. One manufacturer of dextrine,"
"O  near Park, roduces eight hundred weight per day. This product of potato starch is exported to Germany and fo England. \t is sold in France for about 40s. the cwt. One of the uses of dextrine is to form an immoveable bandage for a broken limb. The quantity required for this purpose has been calculated with precision truly French. Two ounces will do for a broken arm, about three for a /eg, a quarter of a pound for a thigh, and between five and six ounces for a collar- bone. Mixed with treacle, dextrine is found to improve the quality of gingerbread and of printers ink. 27. The prolonged action of disastase upon starch causes a formation of sugar as well as of dextrine. Hence the sweet taste of wort from malt, and of a sprouting potato. It seems more than probable that the sweet and “unpleasant taste of a frosted potato is owing to this chemical action of diastase upon the starch, causing a mixture, of dextrine and sugar, which, in the presence of the animalized ingredients of the juice or watery portion, disengaged in breaking up the cells of the tuber, pass rapidly forward from one kind of fermentation to another. M. Payen thinks that frosted potatoes owe their sweet taste to a germination that had commenced before the frost. _It is, however, too sudden a change to be accounted for in this way. There are many interesting circumstances noticed by those that have studied attentively to the action od diastase and the successive formation of dextrin and sugar, by the surprising action of this substance; many of these would be out of place here. Dextrine is very prone to change; it is most efficient at an elevated temperature, but is destroyed by too great heat. Hence malt is spoiled by being long or carelessly kept, and brewing requires careful regulation of heat."
"ON THE MANAGEMENT OF POTATOES, &c. (Continued from page 556)"
"Farmers Gazette, December 20"", 1845, pages 571-572"
"With respect to the fourth point for consideration, the growing of potatoes intended for seed the second year, I would beg to call the attention of the reader to what has been done with respect to the different kinds of grain intended for seed. It has been a regular custom to sow seed upon a particular kind of ground, to take particular care that it is well saved, and afterwards well kept, until it is sown again; in fact, everything has been done with a view to increase its productiveness. But has this been the case with the potatoes ? I fear much it has not—well late than never. Let us now begin anew, and understand what we are setting about. Let us consider well all the facts that the late failures have brought to light."
"To go back to the time when failures were unknown would occupy more space and time than I can at present spare. Suffice it to say, that I doubt much our present stock is becoming diseased and unhealthy, and to renovate and bring it into a healthy and vigorous state again, deserves and calls for our best attention. To obtain this most important result, the plan I would propose to adopt is, first to select a sufficient quantity of the very largest and best potatoes that can be had for the purpose, only the best sets from the rose end; let a portion of fresh ground be chosen, and well broken"
"216  up, and exposed over winter to the frost; let little or no manure be used, and let them bé planted early, that they may be ready for taking up early. Let them be lifted before they are quite ripe; and, above all, let them be spread out and exposed to the sun, until they become perfectly green. This may ail be done before there is any danger of frost in the autumn, provided they were planted at a proper time. What peculiar effect this exposing them to the sun has, I cannot well explain; it is, however, obvious that it gives them time to sweat, and gradually ferment before they are put together. The sun absorbs all the superabundant moisture, the skin becomes thick and better able to resist the influences of external agents which might otherwise prove prejudicial to the constitution of the tubers. But be this as it may, I have had twenty-five years experience of this practice, and up to the present hour have never known potatoes treated in this manner to fail, provided proper care were taken otherwise."
"In support of the theory that to strong manure was partially the cause of the disease this present year, I may mention that I had a trial of this in a field where I had about half an acre (con-acre) planted. The field in question was cropped by different persons, who used, of course, different sorts of manure; some applied what, is called house manure, others horse or stable manure a third planted with cow manure, &c., &c. ; my own were planted on what is known by the name of night soil;"
"the consequence was, that while other potatoes, planted by the side of mine, on"
"weak, bad manure, were perfectly free from disease, one-third of mine were lost. With respect to the raising new and improved varieties from the berry or apple, as it is called, there can be no doubt, that if the same care were taken of the potato that has been bestowed upon flowers and fruits, many varieties, far superior to any we as yet possess, might be raised. Much might be said in support of this expedient; but as my letter has already run to a considerable length, I must confine myself to the points more immediately under our notice. It is a well-known fact, that all improvements, either in the vegetable or animal kingdom, have been effected by crossing (as it is termed) one variety with another of its own kind. To apply this theory to the case before us, we must look out for two of the very best varieties of potatoes known, choosing such as are most healthy, and of the largest size; let them be planted convenient to each other, and whole. The situation chosen for this purpose should be as far distant from the neighbourhood of other varieties as possible. Whenever the plants show their flowers, two bunches should he selected on each plant, and all the others nipped off. In selecting these bunches care should be taken that they be in the same state of forwardness on both plants, so that they may come into flower as near as possible at the same time. When it is observed that the flowers are ready to open, let a thin gauze bag be placed over each bunch, to prevent the bees, and even the wind, from carrying the pollen of some worthless sort, and bringing it in contact with, and aduliterate the flowers. Attend to them every morning for a time, say about ten o'clock, and just as the flowers have opened on either plant, take a flower off one and apply it as follows, to a flower growing on the other:—"
"In the flower of the potato there are male and female organs; the male organs are the little threadlike filaments, on the top of which are placed the anthers that contain the pollen, or fine dust which fructifies the female organ. The pistil is placed in the middle of these thread-like stamens; it is the female part, and is attached to the pericarps, or seed vessel. In order to prevent the male from fertilizing the female organs on the flower operated upon, the former ought to be"
"O  carefully cut out of the flower with a pair of small scissors, leaving the female or pistil standing alone in the centre, then bring the flower entire from the other plant, and gently apply it to the pistil by dusting or touching the one with the other, thereby causing impregnation. Continue to do this with a number of flowers on each plant, crossing the one with the flowers of the other. When the apple is ripe, cut off the bunches and hang them in a warm dry situation for some time. This will help to bring the seed to maturity, after which break the berries, and spread the pulp, containing the seeds, thinly upon a dry board, or sheet of paper, until the whole becomes dry; then rub the dry pulp between the hands, using dry sand to separate the seeds from the pulp; paper them up, and hang them in a dry place, until the season for sowing them arrives. About the end of January prepare a lot of stable manure, as recommended in the case of starting or multiplying the potatoes; prepare beds in the same way, covering them with from four to six inches of fine fresh earth, on which sow the seed, covering very lightly with fine riddled earth; cover at night for some time for fear of frost. By the middle of April the plants will be two or three inches high, at which time another bed should be prepared, similar to the first, but having no frame or lights over it, and the strongest of the plants nursed out in rows, six inches apart, and three or four inches asunder, in a line. About the middle of May, they will be a considerable size, and should be planted out in rows, eighteen inches by twelve. Keep them clear of weeds, and stir the ground frequently about them and as they progress in growth, draw a little up to the sides in the usual way. By this means potatoes might be grown almost to their full sire the first year, at least, to such a size as to enable you to judge of their merits or demerits. Before, they are injured by frost, they should be lifted and spread out upon the ground until they become perfectly green, taking care that frost does not get at them, which may be prevented by using mats or straw for the purpose of covering them at night."
"This leads me to the last point but one for consideration, viz—the best way for keeping potatoes intended for seed from the time they are lifted until the time for planting. I am decidedly of opinion, that all potatoes intended for seed should be ‘exposed to the sun until they become green, before they are stored for the winter. It will be found that when potatoes are so treated, the only difficulty to contend with is, to prevent them from growing too soon. The early varieties should be kept in shallow boxes, not more than two or three in depth, and placed in any convenient cool place out of reach of frost, until planted; and my opinion is, that the middle of March is quite time enough to piant in the open ground. By this time the early varieties, treated as above, will have pushed their burls from two to three inches long, and they should be carefully cut, as before recommended; and if treated in this way, there will be no further occasion for hot beds, as they will be forward enough without them. By managing the early varieties thus, a crop may be ready for use every year by the end of May. The best way to keep the late varieties, intended for a general crop, is to choose a cool dry ‘piece of ground so situated, that the rays of the sun will never reach it, and after the potatoes have been greened, make them up in narrow ridges, covering the top of the ridge with scraws or sods, from a bare pasture. These scraws should come half way down on either side of the potatoes, over which put a sufficient quantity of earth to keep out the frost; when this is done put another scraw over the ridge outside in the same way as it is put on the ridge of a house thatched with straw. They will thus be kept cool and dry over winter. They should be removed from the pit in spring, and spread"
"218  out thinly upon the floor of any outhouse, exposed to the light as much as possible, to prevent them growing."
"When potatoes are allowed to grow too much before they are planted, they become exhausted of the nutritive matter they contain, and will, consequently, not grow so strong again. In every case of cutting potatoes, use quick-lime, as before recommended, and never cut until you are ready to plant."
"In order to induce, as many persons as possible, to join in the experiment of raising new and improved varieties of potatoes from seed, I think the sum of £100 offered by government, should be divided into a number of prizes, not less than £10 each. This would encourage a great many parties to embark in the undertaking, the result of which could not fail to be of the greatest importance to the kingdom at large—"
"Yours, A. CAMPBELL."
"P. S—I have stated that the middle of March is quite time enough to plant potatoes in the open ground, even for the earliest crop. I may mention that I have been in the habit of planting the ash-leafed kidney potato, as recommended above, about the middle of March, for the last twenty years, and that during that time I had them ready for use by the latter end of May. This last year I had planted only about three square perches of ground in ash-leafed kidneys, the seed of which was treated, in every respect, as above (Il mean the second crop), and from so small a portion of ground I sold, for the Dublin market, no less than seven pounds fifteen shillings worth of potatoes of the finest quality. Having mentioned this, I wish, in connection with it, to state, that I am of opinion, where the ground is perfectly dry, and of a gravelly or sandy nature, it may be very proper to plant in autumn, taking care hot to put less than six inches of earth over the sets, and if at all convenient, scatter a little quick-lime over and about them when put down—A.

"27. The process for obtaining diastase (23 is trouble some and costly. Substitutes for it have been sought and discovered: in this way science has advanced the interests of agriculture, manufactures and commerce. Starch is converted by artificial means into dextrine and syrup. The uses of dextrine as a substitute for gum have been already described (26). The syrup is applied to many uses, either in its raw state, or made ‘into sugar. It is easily fermented, at any time, into ale or beer, and is especially applicable to the pale and bitter beers now so popular. The wines of Burgundy are improved in strength, and largely increased in quantity, by the addition of starch sugar. From the beer of wine, it is not difficult to obtain vinegar. From the same source, also, brandy is largely manufactured. We learn from Dr. Kane's deservedly celebrated work on the Industrial Resources of Ireland, that, on the continent, the manufacture of spirit from corn is almost entirely"

"O  abandoned; and it is well known that a large quantity of the French brandy brought into London is potato spirit from Hamburg, coloured with burnt sugar."""
"29. To obtain sugar from starch, recourse must be had to sulphuric acid or oil of vitroil—after long boiling &c, a quantity of chalk is added—then the syrup is clarified with bone black, and mostly used as syrup for the purposes already mentioned. It is, however, converted to some extent into sugar, the value which, when refined, is inferior to that of cane sugar. One part of cane sugar will sweeten coffee or anything else quite as well as two and a half of starch sugar. The cost of the starch being 660, that of the labour and other expenses of making the syrup are 275. Three tons of starch cost 660 francs, and yield three tons of sugar. This sells for 1,050 francs—17.5 francs per cwt., about 1.5d. per Ib., at the rate of 4d. per Ib. for cane sugar. I cannot dismiss this branch of my subject without adverting to the wonderful pre-eminence of the natural product diastase over every resource of art or science which ingenuity has hitherto devised. The caustic mineral alkalies, potash, and soda, require fierce fires and long processes before they can be prepared. These when ready for use are capable of turning starch into a paste, answering, in many instances, the purposes. of glue. Nitric acid or aqua fortis, diluted with 400 time its bulk of water, is sprinkled upon starch; this requires to be carefully dried, and then exposed, for an hour, to a temperature much above the boiling point. The strongest nitric acid, used in this way with 400 of starch, makes a sort of dextrine gum, fit for calico printers. I One part of the diastase effectually change one thousand of starch into good dextrine in tw<minutes, the strongest nitric acid, after a tedious process of hours or days, acts only very incompletely."
"30, We may now briefly consider two or three of the numerous suggestions that have been advanced with a, view to the improvement of the potato culture. The tuber being a kind of sprout or offset or continuation of a preceding plant, something like a graft or layer from a tree or a shrub, it is consistent with reason and experience to infer that every variety, the longer it is cultivated from sets, grows enfeebled by age; and so becomes unable to resist the attacks of external agents, the vicissitudes of weather—cold, rain, heat and frost. Hence is believed to arise a necessity to rear a new races of plants from seed. Yet it has rarely happened that attempts to raise good new varieties have succeeded on a small scale. One reason for this seems to be, that fine garden mould is set apart for this purpose, and the new tubers being then transplanted from a rich to a poor soil, do not prosper. It is important to collect seed apples in a warm and forward summer, because they require a favourable season to ripen. Next, a virgin soil of average quality should be selected, for it is evidently important to raise only such plants as are best adapted to a particular farm or district."
"31. It is quite clear that the starch is stored up in a potato for the purpose of affording support to the young plant until it is able to provide for itself. Now, with respect to most other crops, it is the farmers' practice to nurse, rather than to starve, the germinating plant. Hence the old practice described by Virgil of soaking the seeds of leguminous plants in lees of oil and soda; hence the modern use of rape dust and other substances to accelerate the growth of young turnip plants. In respect to the poor potato the practice is just the reverse. To cut and carve down the set to the starvation point, to plant parings or mere sprouts, as if the object were to delay the growth of the plant and the ripening of the tubers to the latest period. Common sense indicates the planting of whole potatoes in field culture. In rich gardens only, or other very fertile soil, can sprouts or parings"
220  find food at an early and critical period of their existence.
32. It will hardly be expected that I should now attempt to treat what is vulgarly called the potato disease. My own means of observation are much too scanty to
justify such an understanding; and although I have received some valuable
"remarks from intelligent correspondents since I began to write this paper, I think this is not the place to enlarge upon the subject. Two of my friends, without any"
"communication with each other, took the trouble to examine growing plants, on"
"the field, in order to discover the origin and progress of the decay. One"
gentlemen observed it to commence at the portion of the tuber connected with the
"root, on the part nearer the surface of the soil. Another found appearances exactly"
"contrary. Neither of them had any preconceived theory to support, or any other motive for his observations than the desire of interrogating nature to elicit truth. |"
"believe both of them to be accurate in their observations, and to me it seems very"
"probable, that when we can discover the reason why these and other appearances"
"are different in different places, we shall obtain additional light as to the cause of injury to the tubers, and not before. :"
"33. It is quite an abuse of language to say that potatoes are diseased; we do not call venison diseased when it is fit for the cook, or eggs when they are unfit. Our crops fail—tubers are blighted—from some cause, as yet very obscure; they perish prematurely, but not of disease—of murrain, of cholera, of dropsy, or any ill that flesh is heir to. It would be quite as reasonable to say that frost-bitten potatoes are affected with the chilblains, if the subject were not too grave for such trifling."
"34.When a_ potato is pared with a silver knife, bruised in a glass or porcelain mortar, avoiding contact with iron or anything that can give colour, the juice, strained through clean muslin, very soon assumes a dark hue, so that in a few hours it looks like coffee. This is perhaps, the nearest glimpse we can obtain of the precise seat of the mischief. The cells give way, from frost or some other cause; their liquid contents, no longer protected from the air, rapidly undergo the successive stages of that decay to which all organized matter is finally destined. In plants as well as in animals, those fluids that, circulating within their own vessels, minister to life and growth, when no longer sustained by the vital power, become the agents of decay and dissolution. The nature of these changes, the causues that accelerate or retard them, are, doubtless, subjects of very high importance. They are not, however, calculated for detail or discussion before this society. It is enough for me to have invited your attention to the beautiful manifestation of wisdom, power and goodness tkat lie open to all who have eyes to peruse the book of nature. Many of the striking facts connected with my subject may be verified by any one; they have been ascertained in a small watch glass, or a little tube, or on the plate of a microscope. M. Payen, to whom I must again acknowledge myself largely indebted, in his memoirs on vegetation, has elucidated in this manner, questions of the highest importance to science, especially to that agricultural science of which we read and hear so much, but see so little—which in these realms sometimes embellishes Sowers of speech, in other countries multiplies and refines the fruits of the earth. : ;"

221  HOW TO RAISE GOOD SEED POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, January 10°"", 1846, page 597"
"It is a well ascertained fact, that potatoes grown on cultivated land for a number of years, without change of seed, become weaker each successive year, and if continued, would probably become at last quite unproductive; hence the necessity and advantage of change of seed from moss-land, or rather land recently brought into cultivation, and new to the growth of the potato. Farmers in districts long cultivated, proceeding on this principle for more than twenty years, required only to get a few bolls of potatoes grown on such land for seed, with which to raise on their own farms seed for the succeeding year; and from the then comparatively small quantity required there was no difficulty in procuring the necessary change. Now, however, it is very different—farmers have to bring their whole seed each year from such land, and the demand for it is, therefore, now so much increased, and the growing of it has become profitable, that instead of being raised on new land, it is produced where the soil, by the progress of improvement in husbandry, has fast become as highly cultivated as early districts; and it must therefore be obvious to the practical farmer, that potatoes grown on such soil, which, though new twenty years ago, being not so now, will be generally deteriorated as seed, and more fit as an article of food. This circumstance, I consider satisfactorily explains the cause of the failure in one field and the success in another, as plants, from such seed as has had its reproductive powers weakened by being repeatedly grown on improved land, are more liable to injury during all the stages of their growth than those from seed grown on really new land. Farther, I think this circumstance, considered in connection with the sate of the weather throughout this season, may explain the recent more general failure. The continued damp, dull weather during a large portion of summer was succeeded by clear sunshine and heat, and shortly after by cold and continued rains, all which, acting alternately on the refined and therefore weak seed, materially affected the functions of the stem, and brought on premature ripeness in the tuber, which was immediately followed by disease or decay; for it is known that in those fields where the stem had strength to withstand the sudden and trying changes of the weather and remained green and healthy till the usual period of lifting, the crop was comparatively uninjured. The weakness of the seed, however, is, I think, to be attributed not so much to being raised on too highly cultivated land, as to the erroneous manner of raising it. It is usual to plant potatoes four or five inches deep, and earth up the plants as they grow, to prevent the tubers being exposed to light and air. This process certainly improves the potato as an article of food, but, according to my experience, it weakens its productive powers too much to continue its species vigorously; and plants from seeds so grown are very susceptible of injury in unfavourable seasons or soils."
"The remedy I venture to suggest is simple and practical, and within the reach of almost every farmer, and of such a character that it may be easily tried to a greater or less extent, according to circumstances. I propose that a portion of land most suitable to the raising of seed potatoes should be selected, and if it requires manure, let it be applied, and ploughed in during the autumn or winter months. In the spring, let the ground be wrought into a friable condition, and plant the seed the depth of two inches, but not more. During the summer, let the ground be kept loose and free of"
"222  weeds, but do not earth up the plants, and in autumn lift the crop as soon as the shaw or stem begins to lose its greenness. By this method the crop will be as large as by the ordinary one; but, what is of more importance, the germinating powers of the potato will be found greatly improved and invigorated; for the greater number of the potatoes, having grown above ground, will have the advantage of the light and air, to form and strengthen the "" buds"" or ""eyes,"" and, therefore, will be much hardier, and not so easily injured by either rain or frost, as those grown in the ordinary way. This plan approximates in some respects to the state in which all tuberous plants grow naturally, and in questions of this kind it is both usual and wise to inquire how nature continues to reproduce plants or roots. On inquiry, we will find that, in natural plants, tubers are not buried four or five inches deep, and then have two or three inches more earth drawn over them as they grow; this is the work of art, and quite necessary in the case of the potato to make it fit for food, but highly injurious to it for seed, which I will farther prove by the following account of my own experience :—"
"Before I adopted the above method, I had, for several years, failures in my crops of early potatoes, more especially in the ash-leaf kidney and the Adelphi early, but, observing that such potatoes as were accidentally grown above ground, exposed to the light and air, had well-formed ""buds"" or "" eyes,” which were strong and vigorous, 1 re- solved to adopt the said method of growing my _ seed, and have done so for the last four years, and the result is, that my crops are considerably larger, and have no blanks.—"
"Alexander Todd, in Quarterly Journal of Agriculture."
"CAN THE DECAYED POTATO BE RENOVATED ? Farmers Gazette, January 10°, 1846, page 601"
"sia—By an extract in your last GAZETTE, p. 579, I see that Dr. Lindley has honoured me by favourably noticing some remarks of mine on the culture of the potato."
"Happy to agree with the learned professor in some points, it is with much deference that I differ from him in others; but as the subject is of great national importance, and as my experience since 1835 (when I wrote the remarks in your 505th page quoted by him) affords me some facts bearing on it, I venture to lay these facts before your readers."
"My supply of seed (or sets) was purchased from upland moorish soil, in the spring of 1837—-half a ton had remained in the drills till spring. This was much injured by worms, and yielded so inferior a crop that I had it used up by live stock. The rest were flat reds and second earlies. These had been raised in autumn, placed in small heaps, and covered with turf and straw. :"
I planted ina field about 200 feet above sea-level;—soil a rather heavy bluish clay
"on a clay subsoil, lately drained, and where potatoes had never grown before. The manure was farm dung moderately fermented, at about twenty-five cubic"
"O  yards per imperial acre. Part of the sets were cut, part uncut, and all put on the top of the dung in drills thirty-three inches wide, on and just after April 28. One lot, in the middle of the field, was planted without manure. This yielded scarcely half a crop. The manured lots yielded about ten tons per imperial acre (or sixteen one quarter tons per Irish acre). The red and white varieties were nearly equal."
"These were pitted, as mentioned in your Gazette,p. 458. All I could spare were sold for seed, and, by all reports, gave the best crop on every field where they were planted."
"My own crop, in 1838, was on a better soil (from Grey-wacke slate), but the season was very wet, and the whites did not exceed nine tons, nor the reds seven tons, per imperial acre."
"My crop, in 1839, was raised on soil of the same formation as 1838, but earlier and very various in depth. Part rested immediately on the rock. All had about twenty yards of dung per acre. The crop from cut sets was better than that from uncut tubers. On the best parts of the field the crop was eleven tons per acre; but over the whole ground it did not exceed eight tons per imperial or thirteen tons per trish acre."
"Once for all I repeat, that I never saw a blank from failure in any of my fields in any season. I always planted in soils where potatoes had never (or at least for fifty years) grown before. Planting was finished by the 15th May. The seed portion was always pitted with much care. At opening the pits, in April, they were found in high preservation. Sprouting, especially in the reds, had not begun. I heard of no other sets, of the same varieties equally trusted for a first crop on the warmer soils, but many told me they were no better than others, no freer from failures after the first crop. This I ascribed chiefly to bad pitting, but it may have been partly due to the warmer soils hastening the tendency to vegetable plethora, or excess of starch, which seems to impair the prolific powers of the tuber, and render it prone to disease."
"After 1839, 1 found these varieties, in spite of every effort to renovate them, gradually becoming less and less productive. The whites (second earlies), up to the last, gave me about eight tons per imperial acre; but though none failed to grow, the stems were, year after year, losing their former vigour. But the flat reds, in 1843, gave but five tons eight and a-half cwt. on soil where the new Dalquharn variety gave eleven tons two cut. per imperial acre. Their stems became so weak and small, that ‘the rooks made terrible inroads on them during the whole season. They brought 2d. to 6d. per cwt. more in the market than any other variety, but as this did not compensate for the diminished weight of crop, I latterly grew no more than to than to preserve seed."
"For the table this variety is superior to any other; and as mine were raised without any excess of dung, they were esteemed quite a delicacy. They were thoroughly mealy, and to appearance their granules of starch were peculiarly small."
"Of late years the bulk of my crop has consisted of the new variety, referred to in pp."
"457, 506 of your GAZETTE. This always gave heavier crops than any other variety. Its quality has improved much. Its stem is unusually strong; and I am not aware of"
224  the least diminution in the weight of crop since I began to grow it.
"I had hoped to improve valuable old varieties by planting in fresh soil, and careful winter preservation. Few farms afford better means of trying this. The situation is not low. Most of the soil on which they were grown was of medium texture (after the first year). Yet, as a measure for national adoption, my experience seems to forbid it."
"I have long viewed the idea of varieties or species of plants dying from mere old age, as.a fancy, supported by no facts, and opposed by many. Yet, I think it undeniable that varieties are so altered in their nature by culture, that ultimately their prolific powers are destroyed, and cannot economically be restored by any change of culture. They become, as parents, diseased, and incapable of cure or renovation by human skill."
"In its native state, the potato grows chiefly in stem. Its tubers are small and watery. By culture, we diminish the stem, and increase the bulk and solidity of the tubers. After this passes a certain stage, the prolific power of the tubers is weakened. We may long retard this stage by skilful culture; but when it has been once passed, we cannot retrieve the injury that has been done, at least without a ruinous sacrifice: we cannot renovate decayed varieties. I was, in 1836, perhaps the first who recommended the importation of fresh varieties from Peru or Chili, where they are indigenous. We have since had some varieties imported. I feel satisfied that if these can be brought safely through the late murrain, they may be profitably cultivated, till relieved by fresh supplies; but I am still of opinion that occasional importations are indispensable. ."

"SIR- Having read in a recent number of your GAZETTE an article, in which you reasoned from analogy that the late failure in the. potato crop was not occasioned by ""wearing out,"" I trust you will not deem me intrusive for transmitting to you the following facts, confirmatory of your opinion."
"Early in May last I sowed in my garden some potato seed, which I saved myself from the apples of very healthy kidney potatoes. The stalks of the seedlings were very luxuriant in their growth, and remained green long after the prevailing disease was noticed, and after most of the potatoes, raised from sets, had withered. I therefore flattered myself I should have no failure in them; but I was sadly disappointed, when raising them, to find that a few of them were infected. I threw away every one on which I could perceive any appearance of disease, and spread"
"O  the remainder on a dry, airy floor, and left them there for a few days, when I examined them again, and found nearly the half of them rotten."
"On a third examination, a few weeks afterward, I found some more of them diseased; so that on the whole nearly two-thirds of them have been destroyed; whilst the potatoes grown from sets, in the same garden, did not lose more than one-fortieth—I remain, Sir, &c."

"THE POTATO Farmers Gazette, January 10‘, 1846, pages 602-603"
"SIR — Excuse me for requesting the insertion of the following observations, and strictures on a letter by Mr. Campbell, on the ""management of the potato,"" con- cluded in your last. Promising that in these comments, disclaim all intention to write in a spirit of hostility towards Mr. C., or pugnaciously to disparage his abilities; but I mean to examine some of his principal statements, and see how far they are consistent with the leading announcement in his paper, that “a few plain practical directions, on the management of the potato, in the present period, may be of some use to those who, owing to the many conflicting opinions that have been sent forth to the public, know not in which to place confidence, or which to adopt."""
"True it is, that such information, at the present critical juncture, would be of incalculable benefit to the community, were such easily attained; and though his communication is not altogether devoid of interest to unskillful agriculturists, and uninitiated farmers, yet, there are some parts so glaringly ludicrous, and almost positively inapplicable, that the production may not, inappropriately, be classified with those he condemns as useless trash — tending to lead the people from the search of real advantages — diverting them from the pursuit of truly practicable operations — substituting ideal fabrics — phantoms of the imagination."
"If Mr. C.'s suggestions were borne out by his own experience, then, indeed, some reliance might with propriety be placed in that which he writes ; but let me ask him, where has he proved by practice, what he offers as wholesome truths— the result of his own observation and experience for such a length of time ? Mr. Campbell is a very good practical gardener, can grow what his vocation requires — flowers, fruits, and the like, because he has only a small quantity of ground - can attend to these things with unremitting attention; but, for my life, I cannot conceive where he has conducted business so extensively, either on his own account, or for others, as to enable him to dictate to your readers with so much confidence and dogmatism, and to stigmatize other writers as nincompops ! ,"
"In speaking of the preparation of the ground for the reception of the seed, he strongly recommends the ploughing in manure in winter, as likely to prove a damper to the disease now so universal; but to this unqualified recommendation, |, with all deference, beg leave to demur. Farming operations must be regulated by peculiar local circumstances — particular soils require especial and peculiar modes"
"226  of treatment. And thus, as we have a diversity of soil, so every farmer who has any inclination to profit by his employment, will adopt that method of procedure in manuring his land, as he finds, by long continued practice, to be best suited to the nature of his soil, keeping in view the succeeding crops."
"The manure in decomposing must necessarily communicate the same disposition to the potatoes in contact with it. Now, if this be correct, it is certainly astounding to reflect, that Providence has exercised a miraculous power in saving from destruction all the potatoes planted in that way since their introduction. In those seed, which are previously inclined to rot, fermenting manure, no doubt, will accelerate the disease; but that decomposing manure has the power of commu- nicating a similar tendency to sets in contact with it, is not strictly correct, in my opinion, since we find land, in which manure had been ploughed in early, as un- propitious as any other, and therefore we have no guarantee for the truth of this assumption."
"Lest, in entering minutely, I should trespass too far on your columns, I shall pass over unnoticed many tangible parts, and touch nothing but the most specious points as briefly as possible."
"-“Securing a sufficient number of sets for the ensuing year."" This, unquestionably, from its primary importance, deserves our most studious and zealous attention; but, in one or two particulars, I am sorry to be obliged to dissent from Mr. A. C."
"He considers small potatoes as of comparatively little value as seed; but I would be highly delighted if a sufficiency, even of that inferior sort, could be provided; for I can assure him, that I have seen an experiment on large and small seed potatoes, and the latter equalled, if not excelled, the produce of the former. If he has any confidence in what he writes, he would consider them the reverse of what he has laid down. He says, potatoes, intended for seed, should be digged before coming to maturity; he says small potatoes may he considered as ‘abortive tubers,"" and yet they are not good seed |! But what does he next introduce and advocate? Nursing potatoes for seed in hot-beds ! Surely, this is worthy the admiration of every rational man; it is the language of the gardener — the climax of his trifling inno- vations. Anticipating how far this would be received by practical farmers as feasible, he turns and invites the gentry to try. How far he will succeed in enticing even the opulent to act upon his project, anyone can, with certainty, predict. If we expect the great to co-operate with us, we must propose something having, at least, the semblance of efficiency — something likely to meet their approbation; but if they find they cannot serve us, save by converting their demesnes into as many hot- houses, as it were, I fear they will retire inspired with terror at the impracticability of such a plan. No; if nature has peremptorily ordered that the goal of profitable cultivation of potatoes has arrived, and that we may no longer expect them to grow unless they are numbered amongst our delicate exotics, nurtured in hot-beds, and transplanted at the proper season, we may give up such an unequal contest—a prolongation of which must, in the end, produce disappointment. Nature's high behest must be obeyed. "" If she says, "" Away to sunnier climes— to thy original home luxuriate, in thy pristine wildness, as thou were wont to do, beneath the influence of a warmer and more congenial sun."" However, I think, there is no necessity for such fears; and if there were, the above plan would be the last"
"O  alternative, if ever practiced; it would be better and more economical to seek a substitute amongst the many articles fit for the food of man."
"It is very easy for Mr. C. to form a small hot-bed, as such will suffice for his purpose, but to trumpet forth his success, in raising, by this means, a quantity of early potatoes in his garden for some years past, as a sufficient inducement for farmers to "" go and do likewise,"" betrays in a great degree the limited capacity of the horticulturist to estimate the business of the husbandman ; it would do very well for those of his class, but to recommend it as a practicable panacea against the summer demands of the farmer is too ridiculous to be entertained by any one at all conversant with rural affairs. Early planting of the earliest sorts will ensure an early crop, if properly cultivated."
"Mr. C. ascribes the cause of the disease in the Potato to the application of too strong manure, and in "" support of this theory, cites his own case, ""about half an acre (conacre)!"" which was manured with nignt soil, and compares his with those adjoining which were manured with dung of a less stimulating nature; the result was in favour of the latter: I have seen a similar case and no difference could be noticed. He urges the utility of raising new varieties from seed, and thus renovating the existing breeds; and also as a means of averting the now too prevalent disease. For his information, and, if he try the experiment, to save him from unexpected disappointment, I shall quote a few words from a letter in the "" Irish Farmers' Journal,"" detailing the result of an experiment by Mr. Vaux, gardener to the Earl of Mayo. He says, ""I am sorry I cannot give a favourable account of the produce of the potato seed you sent me."" After having carefully planted them for two years successively, he finds they are not at all equal to the varieties now in common cultivation: and further, this year he allowed about a barrel of them to remain for seed, he had them digged in September, ""long before there was any suspicion of the existence of the disease in the neighbourhood. I left them exposed for a week until they were getting green, and then pitted them. As they were perfectly sound when dug out, I did not think it necessary to examine them till yesterday ; and I am sorry to say that I found nine-tenths of them rotten, and those not quite rotten when cut through, showed but too plainly that it was the same disease so common this year. This is, I believe, a plain proof that the disease is not owing to the potato being too long propagated from the tuber.”"
"I feel that this letter is running too far, so that I must draw it to a conclusion. One more remark and I am done."
"Mr. C. unhesitatingly and without ceremony recommends all those things as if prompted from his own experience. It would have been more genteel and manly to have acknowledged the source of his information — where he saw some of those operations carried on, instead of gravely setting down what others have performed, and arrogantly clothing himself with the honour of originality."

"The following remarkable statement, with respect to the treatment of potatoes— which is, in some points, diametrically opposed, both to the scientific deductions of"
"the commissioners, and the long experience of more practical authorities—has been -"
"received by Major Beamish, from the steward of the Gleneask estate (Sligo), of the Irish Waste Land Improvement Society."
"DEAR SIRI am in receipt, of your letter of the 22nd: inst., and am glad to say that the potatoes are not getting worse. During the last month the disease has got a check, and they are now selling in Ballina for one shilling per cwt., of 8 stone (lumpers); other kinds from one shilling to one and sixpence per cut."
"The best preservative that I have found, after trying many, is quick lime, dusted amongst them. When I lifted them on the 15th November, I had a few diseased; I dusted them with lime, and put them into a stove for fourteen days, and then into a pit, and they are as good as when they were lifted."
"Charred turf is not good, but wherever I find a wet pit either here (the model farm) or with the tenants, I find fewer diseased amongst them than in a dry pit. _I also kiln- dried some, and in three days they were all a mass of corruption. Where lime cannot be conveniently had, fine moist bog stuff answer nearly as well to mix among them. Some of our tenants who had their potatoes upon a dry loft, found that they were soon spoiled. I made them take the potatoes down and pit them in moist bog stuff, and they have kept well ever since. _Alll this is contrary to the treatment of former years. Those who have left them in the ground undug, are, I believe, best off. What answers this year never answered in former years, for it was always the practice to keep them dry. _I do not apprehend any great scarcity of potatoes this season, as they were a plentiful crop; and taking into account the failure of the seed in former years, I think the deficiency, if any, will not be much—Yours"

"O  MANAGEMENT OF THE POTATO Farmers Gazette, January 10°"", 1846, page 620"
"siIR—In reply to your correspondent, Mr. Daly, of Chantilly, as he has spoken freely on my letter, I beg leave to take the same liberty with his. In the first place, he says, a part of my letter smells too much of the forcing department of gardening; I would beg of Mr. Daly to take into consideration the case under which I wrote, namely, the increasing the number of sets, supposing there would be a difficulty in getting enough in the spring; and secondly, the forwarding an early crop, supposing there would be a scarcity of food in the early part of the next summer. Now, I beg of Mr. D. to notice all I say on these subjects. In the first place, I say it is fortunate that the small or middle sized potatoes are in general free from disease, and that these, if taken care of, will make very-good seed for one year; but that, as they might he considered in the light of abortive tubers, the produce of them should never be planted a second year. (The last sentence was omitted in the Gazette, although in the MS.) I still maintain that if you plant small potatoes, the produce of smal! ones, they will continue to degenerate from year to year, until the crop becomes worthless. In the second place, I recommended that a set or two should be taken from the rose end of all potatoes before they were boiled; and that, lastly, if a efficiency of sets was still apprehended, recourse was to be had to the only remaining source, namely, to excite the tubers on a gentle hotbed."
"Now, under these circumstances, let me ask Mr. Daly, does he think that it would be a bad plan to make one cwt. go.as far as three, or even two? which, I maintain, could easily be done, although it should be by the ""forcing department of gardening."" I would beg of my friend, Mr. Daly, not to be too sensitive of what smells of gardening, as I rather think the gardener has been no great enemy to the farmer. I wish all our farmers were good gardeners; we should then hear no more of the want of food, as I have no hesitation in saying, that by carrying out the principles and practices of the garden on the farm, double the quantity of food that is now raised might be obtained."
"What does a good gardener do when he sets about the formation of a garden ? He of course first fences it well; he next drains it well; then deepens it well, and lastly, he enriches it with manure. Now if all our farmers would but just adopt the above arrangement, I have no fears of the result. He says he does not approve of forcing potatoes (I only spoke of exciting them), and he says he can guess what the result would be— a miserable failure. This I altogether deny. The result of po- tatoes, so treated, I gave in my letter; and any one who saw the specimens I produced at the June show of the Royal Horticultural Society, where I obtained the First Prize, must be satisfied that they were not the fruits of a failure. To compare them with others brought forward on the same occasion, they were as a goose egg is to that of a sparrow, He says if the ground, or manure, was too weak to keep on the forcing, and that if the sun acted strongly on the buds, there would be a failure."
"Now, suppose the manure had been dug or ploughed into the ground, the ground would not be weak or poor; and I would beg of him to notice that I recommended two or three inches of earth to be at first put over the buds. Supposing this to be attended to as it ought, how could the sun injure them ?—such could not be the"
"230  case. He speaks of weak-drawn buds; but how could this be the case if my plan was adopted. I recommended that only two or three inches of earth should be put over them, and that as soon as the buds begin to make their appearance, plenty of air should be given to make and keep them strong."
"Mr. D. recommends, as an improvement, that temporary frames should be made, and some sand put in them, on which the pots (I suppose the potatoes) intended for seed should be strewn thinly; and in place of glass-lights, he recommends pieces of sticks to be put across them, on which to place bass-mats, or straw, and to be covered at night, and in frosty weather. Now, I would ask him whether he thinks it likely, that the plants would be drawn more according to my plan than by his ? By my plan, they will have good earth to grow in and form roots at first..—by his plan, nothing but sand; and by my plan, plenty of air and light; but by his, shade or darkness. Now, when as much glass can be had for Is. 3d., or at most Is. 6d,, as will cover a frame six feet square, which would hold, as recommended, three cwt. of potatoes, and if we could multiply these three cwt. into nine cwt., I think it would not be a bad thing after ail,"
"In conclusion, I beg to say, that I have left a specimen of potatoes, treated an I recommend, at the office of the FARMER'S GAZETTE, ""where any of the readers of the GAZETTE can call and see them, after which, I hope they will agree with me that they are not likely either to produce weak buds, or a bad crop. And to any others, who may doubt the soundness of anything I have laid down as wholesome truths, !I would respectfully invite them to come to the little place I occupy at Glasnevin, at any time throughout the season, and I will be most happy to show them that / practice all that I preach, At least, claiming credit for good intentions—"
"I am, yours, &c. A. CAMPBELL. Glasnevin, Jan. 15th, 1846."

"ON THE POTATO DISEASE Farmers Gazette, January 24"", 1846, page 630"
"The nest subject was an address by Mr. John Goodsir, on the potato disease. He said, on addressing the society, he wished it to be understood that it was not his intention to submit to the meeting any new facts regarding the diseased structure itself, but, rather, to adduce certain considerations derived from facts already ascertained, and from collateral subjects, which appeared to him to explain the phenomena of the blight, and to reconcile the conflicting opinions regarding it. He observed, in the first place, that it must be admitted by all, that-the blight was an epidemic; and, therefore, there was to be considered in regard to it, first, the general cause of the epidemic — the epidemic influence; and, secondly, the local or individual circumstances, or causes, of attack in the plants themselves. Regarding"
"O  the nature of the general or epidemic influence in the potato murrain, nothing very definite can yet be stated. We know nothing, indeed, of the general influences affecting the epidemics in man and the domestic animals except the existence of such epidemic influences, find, to a certain extent, the laws of their approach, progress, and retrocession. The local or individual causes of attack in the plants themselves here, as in the other epidemics, promise to yield more easily to inquiry, and to afford more legitimate indications for prevention. In various epidemics, Mr. Goodsir stated, that these two causes have different degrees of influence; and it was interesting to know, that in proportion to our knowledge of the nature of the secondary or local causes, was the power we possessed of arresting the progress of an epidemic. The plague, for instance, the secondary cause of which, filthy habits, &e., were well known, is arrested in direct proportion to the improvement in the habits of the people; for the plague is an epidemic disease in which the general epidemic influence is not so powerful as the secondary causes. In Cholera, again, the epidemic influence is stronger than the secondary causes, so that its progress cannot be arrested in the same degree. The general influence appears to be more powerful in the potato murrain than any secondary cause. The plants affected do not appear to be inferior to those of former seasons in quality; at least, they certainly contain as much starch, and as compact a texture, as they usually do. If such be the general nature of the influences bearing on the disease, a remedy or mode of arrest was not to be hoped for to the extent some might expect. Here, as in most diseases In man and the domestic animals, our knowledge of the nature of the disease much exceeded our means of cure or prevention. After alluding to the opinion which appeared to be gaining ground, that contagious and epidemic diseases depend not on an altered condition of the infected individuals per se, but on an influence exerted on them by parasitic or organic beings, developed in or on them—an opinion supported not only by the detection of such parasites in certain diseases, but, also, by the general phenomena of progress, attack, and arrest. Mr. Goodsir elated that he had always, as others had done, detected in the diseased potato at least two kinds of parasitic fungi— One a minute granular, spherical, deep brown body, which existed in enormous numbers from the very first access of the disease—the other a branching filiform tubular fungus, with terminal sporidia, containing spores, and appearing in the potato rather later apparently than the brown spherical parasite. They both exist in the cavities of the polygonal culls of the tuber, the brown fungus adhering to the wall of the cells, and the outside of the coats of the starch cells, binding them together; the filiform parasite branching among and between the starch cells, SO as to be obscured by them. As these fungi are universally present in the diseased potato, we cannot, in considering the nature and cause of the disease, keep their existence out of view. There can no longer be any doubt that the chemical influence produced by the contents of the cells of certain parts of plants produce certain chemical actions in the juices of those, plants, and also that a similar influence was in all probability exerted on certain fluids in which minute fungi exist, such as the yeast plant in yeast, &c.; it is, therefore, a legitimate hypothesis that constant fungi in the diseased potato must direct or influence the chemical actions and effects which have been detected in the diseased tubers. This view of the subject in no way is to overthrow the chemical explanations of the potato blight, but confirms the chemico-vital view of the subject, by combining the opinions of those who apparently differ concerning the disease. In this, as in other"
"232  inquiries of the same kind, the subject has been retarded by the determined opposition of those who examine it from opposite sides, who are both so far correct, but will not admit the conclusions of their opponents. From these, and from other considerations submitted to the meeting, Mr. Goodsir gave it as the result of the inquiries he had made on the subject, that a general epidemic influence, of the existence of which there could be no doubt, but of the nature of which we know nothing, had, during the present season, induced in the potato a disease, the essential nature of which consisted in the growth of two or more species of fungi in the texture of the plant—the plants attacked being in the condition to afford a nidus for the parasites, which condition, however, may not be peculiar to those of the present season—the existence of the fungi being necessary to the constitution of the blight, in 'as much as they afford the initiative, and direct the peculiar che- mical changes which take place in the tuber; and in reference to a remedy or mode of arrest of the disease, it was stated, that as the amount and appearance of the starch granules do not to the eye differ from those in the healthy potato, at least until the root is very much diseased—and as other individual and local circum- stances in the culture and growth appear to have been very much as in former seasons—it is, therefore, to the general epidemic influence, of whatever nature it may be, that the spread of the disease is to be referred—that a cure or mode of arrest is not to be too certainly looked for—it is to be expected, at the same time, that like the influenza and cholera, which have already swept across the globe, the potato-blight may not again, at least immediately, commit its ravages."
"Mr. Goodsir's address was listened to with marked attention, and at its conclusion was warmly applauded."
"Professor Balfour had listened with much interest to the observations of Mr. Goodsir, and had no doubt of the accuracy of the conclusion he had arrived at, as to the existence of fungi in the potato in certain stages of the disease. The . researches of Mr. Berkeley led to the conclusion, that various species of fungi, especially Botrytis infestans, gave rise to the phenomena of the disease. The Botrytis attacked all parts of the potato, including leaves, stems, and tubers. These fungi are never developed in dead matter, but always appear on living bodies. One of them, B. basaiana, causes the disease in silk worms called muscardine. From these and other phenomena of a similar nature, it seemed to be evident, that under certain circumstances, which are still very obscure, animals and plants are liable to the attack of fungi, which modify if they do not cause disease."
"Mr. Goodsir, in further illustration of the subject, adverted to the existence of vegetable fungus in the minnow, gold fish, frogs, and neuts; and as the employment of moss water, as a means of checking the disease, had been recommended by the commissioners in Ireland, it may have the effect of killing the fungi in the potato tuber, in the same manner as creosote is known to destroy vegetable fungus in the human stomach."
"Mr. Lawson then read the substance of a communication from Sir James Miles Biddell of Strontain, and another from his overseer, Mr, Thomas Smith, on a col- lection of potatoes presented to the society's museum, which had been raised from seed collected in October, 1842. The apples were laid in boxes in alternate layers, with dry sharp sand. In the succeeding May they were well rubbed by the hand, with"
"C  the sand, and sown in prepared ground. In the middle of July they showed a good braird; and shortly after some of the plants were transplanted, which succeeded better than those left in the bed, the plants being more vigorous, and the tubers larger. In spring, 1844, they were planted whole, and the collection now exhibited on the table was the produce. The transplanting in July seems a good practice. Sir James states that the produce was quite healthy on 3rd December, when he wrote, and that previous to that period only a very few had been discovered that showed any symptoms of disease, which was the case throughout generally in his neighbourhood. Sir James's opinion is, that the primary cause of the disease is the extreme humidity of the summer and autumn, and this opinion is, to some extent, corroborated by a communication which Mr. Lawson had received from an extensive proprietor in Holland, Mr. M. E. Havelaar, of Rotterdam, of date, the 28th November, who says, that everywhere in strong moist soils the crop had failed, while in dry soils it had produced an average crop; that the potatoes taken up during rain- became diseased, whilst those which were lifted dry did not become so. Throughout Holland generally, in marshy soils, he adds, the disease showed itself in July, in Guelderland in August. Sir James Riddell draws these conclusions—1. That there is no deterioration of the plant—2. That he has no reason to suppose that a fungus is the primary cause—3. That the variable temperature and excessive moisture of the season were sufficient to produce it and 4. That the separation of the diseased potatoes, and drying the good ones, are the only processes necessary to preserve them."
"Mr. Gordon of Cairnbulg took the opportunity of observing, that in the district of Buchan, Aberdeenshire, with which he is connected, and in which potatoes are extensively grown, he had not heard of the disease appearing; but to the contrary, that the late crop in that quarter had been both abundant, and of an excellent quality."
"Mr. Stephens then exhibited a small model of a ventilating pit for keeping potatoes, sent to the society by Dr. Halpin of Cavan, in Ireland, from whom he read a letter, of date the 29th November, containing a statement of the approbation conferred on this, his mode of keeping potatoes, by the Lord Lieutenant, the Press, and other parties in Ireland."
"The paper on the wheat fly, by Mr. Archibald Gorrie, was postponed to the next meeting."

THE LAZY-BED SYSTEM
"Farmers Gazette, February 14'"", 1846, page 630"
"SIR—As ""A Farmer"" has undertaken to advocate the lazy-bed system of planting potatoes, and as he has entered on the task with some forebodings that his assertions would not pass unrebuked, I venture to make a reply in favour of the drill system. Premising this, that I am no Scotchman, but ""a rale Irishman,"" so much do I agree"
"234  with Mr. Keid (whom I do not know) whose letter I have read, that I am satisfied that the lazy-bed system (though this appellation he indignantly discards) as the parent of imperfect cultivation — dirty crops, irregularity, and exhaustion. These are serious charges, and quite condemnatory of the system, if I can substantiate them; and because I think I can, do I attempt to rebut the assertions of ""A Farmer."""
"I feel it is no light thing for any man in the infancy of agriculture in this country, by assuming or using an influential name, to disparage a system which has been profitably adopted in Great Britain; nothing else but because I feel it to be every man's duly to help his fellow man, by the means at his disposal, induces me to impose my opinions to those of "" A Farmer,"""
"The tiller after the lazy-bed system either ploughs the ground into ridges — the manure having been previously spread on it, or he turns it with his spade, then applies the manure— the potato sets having been dropt or “stack” when the furrow is dug up, and they are finished, not a weed, nota particle of the undying scutch- grass, is removed. They are hid, ‘tis true, from the eyes of a Ballieborough farmer, but as summer advances, an intruder here and there appears, and tells the mortifying fact, that a “buried weed is not a dead weed."" Nay, but in the case of unexterminated scutch-grass, like the many-headed hydra, the means taken to supress its growth has extensively increased it, and hence, from this ""imperfect cultivation"" proceeds the “dirty crops"" of corn in this country. For I ask, what mode"
". is adopted when those weeds thus re-appear? Just to break off the shoots, which is called weeding, and then to smother them with mould from the furrow. This verily satisfies the eye, but yet the vitality of the weed is not destroyed; it is feeding as voraciously as ever upon the manure, so that the tiller after this system may complain of his manure, but in reality the fault lies in his mode of tillage. Animals do not thrive when afflicted either with intestinal worms or cutaneous rediculi; well, these weeds, whether concealed or apparent, are, in like manner, absorbing the energies of the soil. Now I say in drills it is almost impossible to have them in this state; the eye tells the fanner his guilt too often to allow him to persist in it. The land is ploughed and harrowed so often that repeated opportunities are afforded of removing the weeds; and then in the scuffling and howing, after the seeds of weeds have grown, and after the grass roots have again ventured to live, they are all removed by hand, or if by nothing else, by exposure to the summer sun. So far I have proved, I hope, that from the lazy-bed system has sprung the imperfect cultivation and dirty crops so general in this country."
"“A Farmer"" says it, and who dare deny it, that ""they (the small farmers) seldom have horses able to plough sufficiently deep; and from this he leads us to suppose that spade husbandry is better and deeper. Now this I deny; for unless in a garden, the turning of land by the spade is a very surface affair; and if their horses are unequal to ploughing deeply for drills, so are they for ridges, stubble, or oats. You, philanthropic sir, ought to have endeavoured to induce the small farmers to improve their horses by taking care of them, and thus one great hindrance to the drill system would have been removed. But why should ""A Farmer"" holding seventeen acres keep a horse and it not fit for work, when it is as cheap to feed a good one as a bad one, and a rood of Swedish turnips, with the light corn, will accomplish that for him in a superior manner, as I have amply experienced this year with a pair of horses and a drill plough, a farmer can put down two acres of potatoes in the day. |"
"O  ask, how many men, in the busiest and most expensive season of the year, as to horse and diet, would he require to effect this, especially at a time when a day is of such importance ? If there was nothing else in favour of drilling but the expedition it insures of getting your potatoes secured from wind and sun, it would be enough, in my mind, to commend it to every farmer small and great—"
"Yours, &c., A CONNAUGHT MAN. Boyle, Feb. 10, 1846."
"P. S. In lifting the crop also, the advantage is decidedly in favour of the drill system; this I proved last season myself. I placed two men on a ridge with only four rows of plants in it, and one on two drills, and started them together, side by side, I myself standing by, in order to insure clean work. The result was, that the one man on the two drills raised one-half more potatoes than the two men on the “four- set"" ridge, in a given space, and one outstripped the two in a very little time, and in the day's work, certainly would have cleared double the quantity of land, with quadruple the weight of potatoes, i.e, one man doing the work of four in the drill system. :"
"UTILITY OF THE POTATO Farmers Gazette, February 14°"", 1846, pages 681-682"
"SIR—It is my intention, in the present communication, to set before your readers a few words, as they occur to me, on the attention and careful culture which the potato merits at our hands, from its being the staple commodity of food amongst the lower and medium classes, not of these countries alone, but, I may almost say, of the civilized world. It is, however, more particularly; with respect to our own country that I am induced to write; and addressing myself to the Irish people, I say, we should pour forth our gratitude, in commensurate terms, to him, long gone, who introduced it, as one of our greatest benefactors. With what scrupulous caution did our ancestors accept what is now the palladium of our dietary; the stronghold against famine; the substantial and nutritious article of food, which it is our benefit to possess, and our interests to make every effort to maintain amongst us. In confirmation of what I have said respecting its nutritive property, need I call in support our population— hardy, active, robust, ruddy, supple, and capable of performing, under what might be considered trying conditions, severe and laborious work; yes, able to compete with, shall I say excel, those tended with better fare. I think, therefore, it will be conceded by all, that it is our best friend, deserving our strenuous exertions, and, if need be, undivided attention to preserve, strengthen, and, if possible, resuscitate so valuable an acquisition, nay, an almost indispensible auxiliary, in the regimen of the human race, which has, last year, received such a terrific and inexplicable check, even threatening extinction. Such being the case, and seeing so many people principally dependent on it for subsistence, passing unnoticed, at present, its uses, as furnishing food for the lower animals, it will be perceptible to every person that it behoves us to exercise our judgment and practice, with all the resources which science imparts to her votaries, in order to smooth down the asperities of our climate and seasons, to"
"236  which are attributed the calamitous failures and diseases which entailed so great, and as yet uncertain, loss in the potato crop."
"In taking a review of the history of the introduction of the potato, and the cold indifference with which it was received in these countries, it is somewhat curious to remark, that tobacco, a plant of the same family, was accepted with alacrity, whilst it was rejected, or almost so, with diffidence. The tobacco plant, so universally known for its narcotic effects on whatever subject may indulge in its use, we should imagine, was not possessed of any enticing properties which would attract attention and recommend it to become so general a favourite, and yet, strange to say, its use became so contagious, that it spread with marvellous rapidity."
"The introduction of the potato into Spain and thence to Italy, Flanders, Germany, &c., took place prior to that of the British Islands: the Spaniards, during their first colonization of their possessions along the western coast of South America, saw the potato growing wild luxuriance in that its native place; they carried some plants with them, and thence it spread over the continent of Europe. We derived our stock in a different way:—It appears to have reached our shores about the year 1586 through the instrumentality of Sir Walter Raleigh: the English colonists brought it from Virginia, in North America. ""It was cultivated first in Scotland about the year 1683, and was then confined to the garden. In 1728, Thomas Prentice, a day labourer, first planted potatoes in the field at Kilsyth"" (STEPHESS'S BOOK OF THE FARM). Such was the success attendant on this trial, that it was soon followed by the farmers in the neighbourhood; and from that time the field culture of the potato extended over Scotland."
"Thus we see that a long time passed by before the nature and constitution of the potato were known; and probably some inherent and peculiar flavour prevented its being esteemed until the ameliorating hand of the cultivator rendered it more palatable, and naturalized it to this climate. It then took its place amongst the crops of the farmer, to whom it had previously appeared valueless, and was only retained in the garden to be looked on more as ornament than use. It was considered in those times a delicate ingredient in the composition of conserves, sweet-meats, &c.; and it was anticipated that it would become, in the hands of the baker, a source of profit, by admixture with flour; and such anticipation has been, and is, verified, by the fact, that bakers use it in large quantities."
"It was first planted in Ireland by Sir Walter Raleigh, in his garden at Youghal, with the story of which almost every person is familiar. Its cultivation here, also, was limited to the garden for a century and a-half. Who, at that time, would have ventured to prophesy even a probability of its ever becoming an article of general consumption ? Who, then, would be possessed of so much hardihood as to say that it should, in the year 1840, become so much in request ? And who would have dared to say that, in 1840, Ireland should be in imminent danger from want of potatoes; that it should constitute the food of the people, to the almost exclusion of other substances ? No; it was regarded as of comparatively little value, and from this circumstance it was considered unworthy of their attention; in fact, it had at one time been in such disrepute as that it was only in the garden of the amateur, and its culture had grown into desuetude. But as its improvement proceeded, and as new varieties were produced superior to the parent stock,"
"0  both in fruitfulness and taste—as their good qualities were gradually developed, so their cultivation became more extensive; they took a more prominent position among the other crops, as ignorance and prejudice were expelled the minds of the people; and, finally, when they were known and appreciated, they were recognised as of the utmost importance to man and beast, and an impetus was given to their extension, until they occupied their appropriate place in the regular rotation. So that what primarily was tardily acknowledged to possess utility, is now ""prized above all price""—and with justice, too, as it has been proved to be a true friend to the poor, who cannot aspire to luxuries, yet find in it a wholesome repast, and at least can say, "" Our board is covered with plenty."""
"What an abundant supply of food do we possess in the potato, for the support of cattle, horses, pigs, and fowls. There is no one sort of crop adapted to so many © purposes as the potato.—none so subservient to the profits of man; and from its adaptation to almost every soil and climate— from the torrid zone to the more biting frigidity of northern latitudes—we may, with justice, infer, that there is no plant which we cultivate——none on the production of which the sweat of our brows is expended so profusely, is so invaluable.—none better calculated to afford an ample return for our trouble. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to bestow requisite attention and unremitting assiduity in effecting so desirable objects as its improvement and proper cultivation, to bring into action every energy for its maintenance amongst us, now that its constitution appears to be debilitated, and that from some apparently inexplicable cause or causes, a cessation or derangement of some of its operative organs has caused such apprehensions of famine, and our future success in growing it."
"Although the fears entertained, I have no doubt, will be proved groundless, if similar prejudicial agencies do not recur in the ensuing season, yet we should be astir and working, prepared to encounter adverse circumstances—endeavour to counteract, but better prevent, such an untoward event; and I am convinced that our exertions, if judiciously directed, will ultimately be crowned with success; and when we reflect that all the benefits of the victory will accrue to ourselves, it should stimulate us to activity, should arouse us from passive submission, should awaken us from dormancy, infused with fresh vigour, to combat whatever resistance climate and season may offer—for surely the object of contention is more than worthy the struggle."
"I have endeavoured, though very feebly, to show forththe claims of that excellent esculent, the potato; andcontended, as fully as the limits of a letter would warrant, that it is intrinsically valuable as a Jit and ready food forman's use, as well as of the lower animals, I shall concludeby saying, that though my advocacy of its utility is altogether inadequate to its deserts, your readers will acceptthe ""will for the deed."" I may, in a subsequent letter,direct attention to the most approved modes of cultivation."

IS THE POTATO DISEASE PROGRESSING?
"Farmers Gazette, February 14°"", 1846, page 684"
"Since the publication of my notes on the potato disease, my attention has been directed to its progress in several districts in the north of Ireland; but as, of late, the representations of those who have given these, opinions to the public, on, this subject, have been regarded as deriving some colouring from the peculiar feelings which the writers might entertain, on certain political questions, I have felt unwilling to respond to your request, to communicate the result of my observations, until I should, from personal examinations and inquiries, have ascertained the actual state of the crop, at the present time, in some of the leading agricultural districts of this part of the kingdom."
"You are aware that, at the first invasion of this terrible scourge, I was disposed to regard with suspicion many of the statements put forward respecting the amount of damage. Careful investigations, however, in various parts of the county of Down, obliged me to admit, that everywhere, in every description of soil, and on every kind of potato, the mark of the destroyer had been placed; and I was induced to warn our farmers, that unless some means were taken to sore up the crop, in some form capable of resisting decomposition, the worst consequences might be apprehended— that scarcity, and all its attendant evils, might be expected. Fortunately, since that time, our farmers have not been idle, and, by the farina mill, a large amount of the crop has been rescued from total destruction. By the large farmer, also, the potatoes unfit for human food have, with advantage, been used in feeding cattle, though, for a considerable time after the invasion of the disease, they were not generally applied for that purpose, from a fear that they might prove injurious. Experience, however, happily corrected this opinion, but not before an immense waste of what might have been usefully employed had taken place."
"During the month of January, I had occasion to visit several districts in the counties of Down, Armagh, Antrim and Monaghan and I carefully inquired into the state of the"
"O  potato crop. I found, that though there was considerable differences in the amount of the loss, in the districts examined, yet, that everywhere, with a few trifling exceptions in some moory soils in county Monaghan the disease continued destructive ravages, unchecked by any of the methods recdmmended to stop its progress; that in every description, of pit, in the moist field, and on the dry loft, the potatoes were, either as the farmers expressed it, ""melting away,"" or shrivelling up with a dry rot. In some districts in Armagh, I was informed, that the destruction was progressing with such terrible rapidity, that of potatoes raised, thrice picked, and stored up in pits, as free from all taint, not more than one-third was found fit for use some days ago. In the neighborhood of the ‘ city of Armagh, the extent of loss was represented as very great. Soon after the commencement of the disease in this country, active exertions were made, by some of the benevolent inhabitants of that city, to have the rotten potatoes converted into farina. A Joint-stock Company was got up, buildings taken, and the whole arrangements placed under the direction of a person: who was considered competent to manage the business; but, by some mismanagement, the Company was obliged to discontinue its praiseworthy efforts. In the neighbourhood of Markethill and Portadown, the loss has, also, been very great, and will, I fear, be severely felt by the small farmers in that part of the country. IN Monaghan, I made particular inquiries from several farmers—among whom I may mention the name of Mr. Gowdy, one of the most intelligent agriculturists in the district in which he resides—and I found it to be the general persuasion, that fully two thirds of the crop, is bad, at that time (6th of January), been rendered unfit for food. Along the north- east coast, again, in the neighbourhood of Larne, the destruction has also been great; and several Antrim farmers, whose names, if required, can be supplied, have, last week, assured me, that the stock of potatoes which they have at present on hands, is not so large as they were, in former years, accustomed to have in the month of May. In the neighbourhood of Dowopatrick, the loss has not, perhaps, been so great as in some other parts of the country; but, in every house in town where potatoes have been stored, and in every farm in the district surrounding the town, so far as I have inquired, I find that the destruction progresses. On this day (2nd inst,), I had a conversation on the subject, with a respectable farmer, in the parish of Inch, Mr. Richey, who informed me, that in former years he was accustomed to sell from 800 to 1,000 bushels of potatoes; but that this year his stock was already so far reduced, that he was afraid, though his crop had been large, that he would not have enough for his own use. I give you the above results of my inquiries, without any comment."
"As the diseased portion of the crop, which is considered unfit for use at the table, is now very generally employed, by those whose circumstances admit of it, in feeding cattle, it may be interesting to direct attention to a method of using potatoes, which, is said to increase their feeding-properties: it is translated by Professor Johnston, the active chemical officer of the Agricultural Chemistry Association of Scotland, from a work published in Norway. The inventor of, this method washes, the potatoes well, steams them thoroughly, and then, without allowing them to cool, crushes them in a mill, and mixes them with a small quantity of water, and three ibs. of ground malt to every 100lbs. of the raw potatoes. The mixture is kept at a temperature of 140 to 180 degrees, and when it has acquired a sweet taste, is ready for use. Its advantages in feeding are said to be—."
"1st. That it is a richer and .better food, for milch cows, than twice the quantity of potatoes in the raw state."
"240  2nd. That it is excellent for fattening cattle and sheep, and for winter food; that it goes much further than potatoes, when merely steamed; and that it may be economi- cally mixed up with chopped hay and straw."
"This method, in the present state of matters, is worthy of the attention of those interested in feeding cattle—"

"THE FAILURE OF THE POTATO CROP IN IRELAND Farmers Gazette, February 14, 1846, pages 684-685"
"The following is the extract from a report of the commissioners of inquiry into matters connected with the failure of the potato crop, which was laid on the table of the House of Commons lately by Sir J. Graham, at the request of Mr. O'Connell :—"
"""Dublin Castle, Jan. 20, 1846. ""We have not understood it to be within our province to suggest to the government"
measures involving important questions of policy; but we consider it not only within .
"our province, but our imperative duty to bring, without further delay, under the notice of government a state of circumstances which appears to us to call for immediate consideration, and in which questions of policy may be involved."
"Two cases of a very pressing nature have been under the consideration of the board, which for the present have been disposed of by a suggestion, that those in- terested in the respective localities shall avail themselves of the act, 1st Victoria, c. 21, which enables the Board of Works, upon certain preliminaries being taken, to advance money for the execution of local works."
"We beg to refer your Excellency to the reports of these cases, and especially to that of Nobber, as presenting probable indications of that which must be expected in very many instances to occur. We cannot disguise from ourselves that the remedy which we have suggested in these cases may fail of being successfully adopted, and, if adopted, may be but a temporary alleviation of the distress then prevailing; and that numerous cases of distress are likely to occur, and some are near at hand, for which neither the act pointed out by us, nor any other, as far as we know, in existence, or in the contemplation of government, can provide an effectual remedy."
"It appears from undoubted authority, that of 32 counties in Ireland, not one has escaped failure in the potato crop; of 130 poor law unions, not one is exempt; of 2,058.electoral divisions, above 1,400 are certainly reported, as having suffered; and we have no certainty until the receipt of the more minute returns now in progress of completion, that the remaining 600 have altogether escaped."
"Every variety in point of extent of loss, and every shade of subdivision in point of locality, will be found in the returns laid before us; and this circumstance, while it"
"O  implies an exemption from widely extended and uninterrupted loss in one continuous locality, complicates, on the other hand, and renders difficult the application of relief in the manner apparently most desirable, by employment in labour."
"The poor-houses will, without doubt, be found a most important means of relief; and we consider it a rnost providential circumstance that such an extensive resource is available against a calamity more widely extended and more serious in its nature than any that has affected the Irish poor since the year 1817. We have the satisfaction to know that this resource is still open to a very great extent, and that even in the most distressed districts the poor-houses are far from being full. We look with anxious attention to their progress towards repletion, as a strong though not conclusive indication of the state of the union to which they belong. We refer, however, to the constabulary report of the recent occurrence at the poor-house at Kells (in which union Nobber is situated) for a proof that it would be unsafe to rely on the state of the respective poor-houses, either as a certain test of the amount of distress in the union, ‘or as a sole resource for its relief."
"The ordinary expenditure for one year of the poor-houses in Ireland is about £260,000, including establishment charges, repairs, and installment for repayment of building; and taking the largest pecuniary estimate of the relief which their capacity would afford, we cannot consider it as at all equivalent to meet any such deficiency in the crop as that estimated."
"In turning, therefore, from this branch of resource for the poor to those afforded by existing and contemplated laws for the encouragement of public works, we are met by difficulties attaching peculiarly to the present emergency."
"In all cases of public distress it is necessary, as stated by the committee of 1822 (May 16), to prefer small local undertakings, where employment in labour is to be given to those on a great scale. Works on a great scale have a tendency to invite an accumulation of numbers to a given spot, and, probably, to disappoint the greater portion of them."
"That which is necessary on all such occasions is peculiarly necessary now. The extreme variety in the extent of the potato failure, and the minute and insulated subdivisions of land in which it prevails, leads us to entertain the greatest doubt whether any adjustment of .public works can be made to meet the need wherever it may occur; and it must be met, or death from famine may be the result."
"Sir John McNeill, a highly competent authority, in a document transmitted to us, estimates the distance to which the benefit of employment in public works extends at five miles only."

"Sir- Having had many years' experience in the use ofthe meal made from Indian com, as an article of food for man, I can, most confidently, and strongly, recommend it as such, and have no hesitation in stating that, after some slight prejudices against it are removed, by a fair and dispassionate trial, it will, in a short time become a favourite with the people generally, and supersede the use of oatmeal. ;"
"The various ways of cooking the ""Indian, meal"" differ not from those practiced with oatmeal, say, water or milk porridge, cakes, dumplings for the broth or soup-pot, &e."
"The corn, in its whole or crashed state, forms a superior article of food for horses, black cattle, pigs and poultry. : :"

"THE LAZY BED SYSTEM Farmers Gazette, February 21°', 1846, pages 697-698"
"Sir— I should regret much had the letter on lazy-bed potatoes not been replied to. My own avocations press me so much that I had no time to do so earlier. I perceive it has been well answered; and though still much hurried, I wish to. corroborate the testimony of the writer in favour of drill cultivation. I know that potatoes grown in drills are far preferable to those grown in lazy-beds: they contain a much greater proportion of large and marketable potatoes; they take less seed; the dung is more within reach of the plant; in digging or ploughing out; the dung and enriched earth are distributed equally over the field; whereas, in beds, the dung and good earth are thrown into the trenches to even the surface, and the centre left bare. The effects are seen, in. the after-crop. This year the superiority of drills was manifest in a field part in beds, part in drills. The potatoes in the beds were almost a total loss—those in the drills little injured, and why ? The superabundance of early rain lodged and remained in the beds; it ran down in the furrows of the drills. The radiant heat which followed dwelt too powerfully on the flat bed; but it glanced off the raised drill and did not injure the"
QO  plant by too rapid a vegetation.
"In drill potato husbandry the dung is at once, when drawn out, spread, and constantly covered; the ammonia, the principal food of the plant, is all preserved, and the dung is under the young plant in all its original strength and vigour. In beds, this cannot be done; the dung is chopped in small heaps from the cart—often left in this state for days, the ammonia evanescing, then it is spread on the whole surface, left exposed to discharge all the rest of the fertilizing gases, until the furrow can be dug and shovelled; thus its strength and value are weakened; but it is said it generates food for plants in that state, so it does; and so does clover, when a first crop is cut, throw up a second; but I know of no one, because he is to have a second crop, throwing away his first, or giving it to his neighbour?, at least, there is no such donkey in my neighbourhood."
"A drill crop of many acres can be worked, by the farmer, from its planting to its lifting, with a pair of horses, and in many stages with only one and he can then employ his people in draining the land, which now he cannot do without extra hands, at planting the potato with the spade, digging and shovelling furrows, and what is called weeding and digging out the crop, occupy the men almost all the year: as a person remarked, they are employed first in hiding them in the ground one part of the year, and the other part in looking for them again. In drills, most of the work can be done by women and children, which, in beds, require men; the ground is more improved; the frequent stirring, hoeing, and moulding the much greater surface exposed to the atmospheric influences, ameliorate and improve the soil, reduce clayey soils to a friable mould, and render it free for the admission of the minute fibres to extract the fertilizing gases to invigorate the crop. In Scotland, that country of agricultural perfection, based on science and practice, a field in bed potatoes is not to be found. In drills, the crop has room to admit the atmosphere, the light, and the heat, round every plant; in beds, this influence is prevented, from their being crowded together; the stalks are mostly weak, the leaves small, and the growth of the root retarded."
"The drill husbandry has a beneficial influence on the farmer's mind; it makes him look to the future. To have a good crop, he knows he must double plough his stubble; as soon as the corn is off it, either trench-plough or subsoil-plough. By so doing in time he can have a stolen crop of rape, store turnips, or rye, giving two cwts. of guano per statute acre, or an equivalent of liquid manure. When these crops begin to start in February, during March and April he has a quantum of feeding which ten, ay, twenty times the extent of grass land would not afford him. Adopting the drill husbandry starts him in a system well called a rotation, going on with the regularity of a revolving wheel; he ploughs his lea land for oats when the ground is soft in February or March, and does not wait, as the lazy-bed cultivator does, until the latter end of April or middle of May, to plough the bawn, which is, at that time little softer than stone, hardened by the winter rains and the trampling of cattle, working it into a brick, which the plough and a man leaning on the beam can scarcely turn three inches. We may despise the Egyptian with his plough, a piece of stick, cutting the ground; but those who have glass windows should be cautious how they throw stones. The lazy-bed ploughman is often hardly a shade better. It is well called a lazy-bed, as it proceeds from a lazy mind, and where that is, there cannot be an active hand. There may be a hop and a step and a jump, but there"
"244  will not be that steady perseverance which enabled the tortoise to win the race from the hare. Lazy it is in every way, and every tiling connected with it is lazy and slothful; the ground is lazy; it is hard as the nether millstone; it was not ploughed; it was hardened by rain and cattle and no root, much less the tender gossamer root of the potato can enter it. The root of the potato is lazy, it tries to penetrate the obdurate soil; it is like the viper biting the file, the root turns this way, and that war, and all sorts of ways, but there, is no admission, and it gives it lip and becomes lazy. Laziness brings dirt, laziness brings poverty, and I am sure ii will be granted that the lazy-potato bed having brought both deserves its name."
"in the drill, the earth is porous and loose, and allows the rain and the dew to |"
"penetrate; in the beds—the dirty, impoverishing lazy-beds-——the ground is hard, the dews remain on the surface, the rain is stopped from going down by the hard unploughed ground; and if there be a quantity, it is all about the potato, preventing the growth of the young, and rotting those come to maturity. In dry weather, from the little depth it has penetrated, the moisture is soon dried up, and the plant languishes in drought. Exactly the reverse is the case with drills: the ground is deeply ploughed, the rain penetrates, and the sun draws it up to the roots, and they have enough even in the driest weather, and no superabuadance to injure them even in the wettest for if there were; it would escape through tile furrows, and the potatoes and their roots are all above the influence. I hope I never will hear of or see a lazy-bed potato again; it is only an excuse for laziness of the mind, want of a regular system in the head, and want of skill in the hand; and our countrymen must not deserve such imputations; and, I hope should it be ever applied, it will be known to be a groundless slander,—"

"LAZY-BED SYSTEM Farmers Gazette, February 21°', 1846, page 698"
"The following letter from ""A Scotchman,"" in reply to “A. Farmer,"" on the lazy-bed system, was rejected last week, as we considered it rather low and satirical for our columns. Having, however, received a request to suppress the more objectionable parts, and publish the rest, we have done so; but beg to say that, in any future discussion on this subject, nothing will be admitted which is not more calculated to advance improvement than excite ill feelings:—"
"siIR—"" A Farmer"" in your last GAZETTE concludes his advocacy of the lazy-bed system by expressing a wish that his remarks may tend to create a discussion on _the subject."
"To make. out a case against the drill system, he cites the evidence of ""many first-rate agriculturists;"" and before stating my defence of it, I would ask these men how long they have been "" first-rate agriculturists?"" and have they found, after years of experience, that the lazy-bed is eligible in a regular rotation, in which the potato is considered as the cleaning crop ? and, if so, does it"
"o)  afford equal facilities for destroying weeds and otherwise preparing the ground for future crops as the drill system would do? __ If they can show me it has all these advantages, and that they find it more profitable to drain their land every other year with trenches occupying a space nearly equal to what they benefit, rather than drain it at once by a method which would afford them the proper use of the whole natural surface of the field, I will then give up my opinion of it; but, till then, I can only say, from my ""experience and observations,"" made within the extent of my narrow comprehension, that whatever utility there may be in the lazy-bed as a mode of growing ""dry"" potatoes, it is not eligible in a system of productive farming. To venture a definition of it, I would say that it is a rude, lazy mode of planting and growing a crop of good potatoes and weeds at a great waste of manual labour—a waste of land and manure, with positive injury to succeeding crops."
"In thus defining it, I have omitted the words "" stupid “and ""system,"" and retained the term ""lazy,"" though ""A Farmer"" thinks it quite misapplied, in as much as it requires much more manual labour than drills. His reasoning might be right did the term apply to the operator, and not to the operation; but as it is, I cannot accept his logic."
"It may be said these objections cannot apply to the case of small farmers, who have no other source to which their labours can be so profitably directed as in the culture of their ""chief food,"" and although at a waste of labour and injury to other crops, their favourite morsel ought to be the prima donna of their industry."
"Now, sir, whatever comforts such a course may have procured heretofore, ""I doubt the policy of encouraging"" it in future; the calamities of the present year tell too deeply the evils which attend it. The British government have been paralysed at the necessity of procuring a supply of food for four millions of people, whose time and energies have been almost exclusively devoted to the production of a vegetable which, for the last few years, has been but a precarious crop, an evil"
"_ which, in some measure, might have been, averted, had a portion of their time been occupied in raising other crops alike suited to their soil and circumstances. ""A Farmer"" seems to coincide in this view, in remarking that it is fortunate for Scotchmen that potatoes are not their principal food. But why, I ask, is Scotland thus favoured ? Is she blessed with a more genial climate, or a more fertile soil ? or are her "" hardy sons"" gifted with superior talents? If not, it must be In the application of these gifts that she is more ""fortunate"" than the sons of ""the Green Isle"", who have long doubted the policy of following her example. And why ¢rust the potato be the chief food of the Irishman ? Is Erin's soil so ungrateful that it will yield him nothing but ""Iumpers"" for his labour ? or is there any peculiarity in his physiology which would prevent him eating oaten cakes or stirabout? Every succeeding harvest in Scotland proves that these things would agree “mighty well, entirely,"" with him, were he accustomed to their use."
"""A Farmer"" seems to think that his favourite system would find its way to Scotland, were it not that labour there is so dear. Now, sir, I would not wish to contradict his assertion were he alone in this opinion; but it is too prevalent an idea that low wages and cheap labour are identical but my experience, and I believe that of many others placed in like circumstances with myself proves the reverse is the fact,"
"246  which militates very much against us in our endeavours to raise the wages of those we employ. In case that I may be considered boasting of the prowess of my countrymen, and ""None but fools boast,"" I quote, for the information of ""A Farmer,’ passage from Professor Kane's ""Industrial Resources of Ireland"":—"
"""A wretched man who can earn by his exertion 4s. or 5s. a week, on which to support himself and farm and pay the rent of a sort of habitation, must be so ill fed, and depressed in mind, that to work as a man should work is beyond his power: hence, there are often seen about employments in this country, double what would be required to do the same work, in the same time, with British labourers. The latter would probably be paid at least twice as much money per day, but in the end the work would not cost the employer more although the wages, therefore, in the former example were lower, labour was not cheaper, on the contra] somewhat higher, as the trouble of overseeing twice the number of men is a source of additional expense.” ; ;"
"Should this not satisfy ""A Farmer,"" I will fill page of your GAZETTE with incontrovertible evidence that, although wages are much lower, the expense doing the same amount of work is far higher in Ireland than in Scotland—a fact, in a _great measure to be ascribed to the influence of such methods of working the significant lazy-bed, which affords no opportunity of acquiring skill or taste. Where an Irishman is provided with sufficient food, placed under proper training and furnished with suitable tools, he is not excelled in agricultural work, and none are more grateful for the comforts which profitable labour afford him ; but in my own dear country ""he is taught and encouraged waste to his labour"" for that which satisfieth not,"": philanthropic friends having long doubted the policy of encouraging him to embrace science, skill, and system; to aid his ""thews and sinews."""
"In the performance of my duty, I permit small farmers to practise the lazy-bed ‘method on bogs, or breaking up old marshy ground; but, in all other cases, I set my face against it as ""an evil thing."""
"No farmer ought to keep horses unfit to do justice to the plough; and if his means cannot afford a sufficient team, he ought to have no more land than he can work properly with the spade."
"I am afraid I may not have expressed myself scientifically; unfortunately for me I had bade ""Farewell Lochaber"" before the agricultural schoolmaster had gone abroad (to Glasgow). Few of my countrymen in my line of life are adepts in the English language, and my nation is the only apology I can plead for the many errors I may have made in this attempt to defend opinion which my experience tells me I ought to uphold."

©  LAZY-BED SYSTEM
"Farmers Gazette, March 7"", 1846, page 730"
"Sir—l regret to observe that the letter on the advantages of the lazy-bed system of cultivation has not been replied to in a very candid or liberal spirit. Its opponents have clothed their system with every possible advantage and perfection, while upon it is heaped every fault and folly that the most fertile imagination could suggest. Truth, however, is generally found to rest between extremes; and I would hope that after a more impartial examination, it will appear that after all black's not so black, nor white so very white."
"If the method of cultivating potatoes in ridges described by your rev. correspondent be universal in his district, I do not wonder that he wishes never to see or hear of a lazy-bed again; but, before condemning the system, I would advise him to visit the ""black north,"" where a very different plan is adopted by all good farmers. As it is not likely he would wish to travel ""so far away from the sun,"" I will endeavour to describe as concisely as possible."
"We plough as early in November as possible, with, pretty deep furrow, and generally across the direction of the ridges. In spring it is harrowed, and again ploughed, harrowed, picked, and roller, and, if necessary, a third time, till the land is as clean and fine as intended for drills. It is then neatly marked with plough into ridges of from 5 to 5.5 feet in breadth, with spaces of from 18 inches to 2 feet for the trenches. The seed is then put in, but not at the back of the spade but, by opening holes about 2 inches deep with the point of the spade—the clay taken out of one row covering the sets in the preceding one. Six sets are put in each row, and the rows are from 12 to 14 inches distant. It is a very expeditious way of putting down the seed, as two men with two droppers will put down half an acre per day. If the weather be very dry, roller is passed up and down the ridges to preserve the seed. In about ten days or a fortnight the manure should be put on. As soon as it begins to be draw-out, it should be spread, and carefully covered. I have often put down my crop from beginning to end without ever having more than two loads in the field in advance nor having it spread more than a quarter of an hour until it was covered up."
"As soon as the plants appear above ground, the trenches should be dug and shovelled. Some, however prefer waiting till they are half a foot high, and then mould them, as it renders weeding almost unnecessary However, if all the preceding operations be well performed, weeding will be comparatively easy."
The digging of ridges is a little more tedious than drills; but it is more than counterbalanced by the ease of ploughing afterwards. I have never known any body so foolish as to throw the rich earth and manure into the trenches to fill them up; on the contrary we take all the pains we can to keep it on the middle of the ridges.
"248  I have looked over the letter of ""A Scotchman,” but do not find any argument in favour of his views, except his own limited experience. Now I would beg to inquire if he has had any experience of the above method; and, if so, I would feel obliged if he would point out its defects ?. I may be partial to it, as it is associated with my earliest recollections; but I have cultivated a part of my crop in drills for more than seven years, and have not found any advantage from it, either in cleaning the ground or increasing its fertility; and I would here remark, that all the arguments that have yet been advanced do not apply to the lazy-bed system, but to the lazy, indolent, and careless manner of preparing the soil, and conducting the operations. — ;"
"""A Scotchman"" will, no doubt, be gratified to learn that the drill system is extending yearly in this neighbourhood. They are, of course, becoming ""first-rate agriculturists;"" but how far they are entitled to that distinction, we shall see by and by. They commence by giving the land a light ploughing in winter: in spring it gets a harrowing along with the rest of the farm. It so remains until near the time of planting; if it be very stiff it gets a second ploughing and harrowing, but most of them think it will be time enough to clean and pulverize the ground during the summer when the horses will be idle. They then commence drawing out the manure, perhaps for a week or ten days. Three or four farmers then club together to put down their crops in rotation. They commence by opening a drill; the seed is then put in, and the manure put over it, and the plough, in returning, covers all up. Some do not drill, but merely plough the ground, putting the seed and manure in every third furrow. From the carting out of the manure, the ground is generally in very bad condition, and the drills irregular. All is hurry and confusion to finish the day's work, as they must be with another farmer next day. The after culture is often as inefficient to clean the ground as the preparation. They generally find, that instead of harrowing out the weeds they are only tramping them in. The sides and bottom of the drills, from the working of the plough, and the horses feet, become as hard as a road; and if the land and manure he not very good, the weeds, in spite of every effort, will soon overpower the crop. I have thus described both systems as practiced by farmers in this district, and leave it to every unprejudiced reader which of the two is the ‘most "" rude lazyy mode of planting a crop of potatoes ata great waste of"
"_ land and manure."""
"I am not surprised that gentlemen farmers, and their stewards, should prefer the drill system; for it would be nearly impracticable for them to get their labourers to perform the other system with that care and expedition, which is necessary, because they do not feel interested in what they are doing. It is only among that class that the strange anomaly of low wages, and high labour, is to be found. And I have every reason to believe that Irish farmers, and their servants, are as active and intelligent as any other, of their class, in the empire."

"THE LAZY-BED SYSTEM Farmers Gazette, March 7"", 1846, page 731"
"SIR—If you think that any light can be thrown upon what is called the lazy-bed system by an humble man, who has had much experience on the subject during more than forty years, but who has little theoretical knowledge beyond what he has derived from your pages, I have to request you will insert the following remarks In your paper. I have carefully read over the letter of the Rev. Win. R. Townsend, and though I hear he is a most knowledgeable man in these matters, I think that, on reflection, he will admit that he goes too far in applying so many hard words to the lazy-bed system, which, perhaps, weaken the force of his very good letter. Passing over these, I come to his arguments, and I shall point out in what respect my experience has been different from his. I have found potatoes grow in as large quantities and of as large size in lazy-beds as in drills, where the former had equal justice done to them in the cultivation. If the drills take less seed it is a mere trifle; and I can give a most decided opinion that drills require considerably more manure than do the lazy-beds. Mr. Townsead says that, "" in digging or ploughing out, the dung and enriched earth are distributed equally over the field; whereas, in beds, the dung and good earth are thrown into the trenches to even the surface, and the centre left bare."" Now, far be it from me to differ improperly from a gentleman like Mr. Townsend, but, with all due respect this quotation satisfies me that he does not, understand the lazy-bed system, or he would know that in digging the potatoes the first spadeful at the edge is turned up, and set back on the ridge before the digger, and that, the second spadeful turns the sub-soil, beneath the last spadeful into the trench, so that when the whole field is dug, the manure and enriched earth are throughout the whole field left on the surface. I don't think much of his argu- ment about ""the sun dwelling too powerfully on the flat bed, and glancing off the raised drills.”"
"Surely Mr. Townsend is hardly serious when he says, that in drills the dung “is at once drawn out, and immediately covered,"" whereby the ammonia is preserved; but that, ""in beds this cannot be done,"" and the dung is often left exposed for days, the ammonia evanescing. For upwards of forty years I have been putting in potatoes, both in drills and in lazy beds, and I cannot even guess at a reason, why the dung should not be as quickly covered in one case as in the other; and I have been accustomed to see the lazy-bed manure covered just as soon as that in drills. On the contrary, with small farmers who have but one or two horses, this argument is all against the drills, as they must first use the horse in drawing out the manure and let it lie there until a sufficient quantity is out, and not until then can the horse be put into the plough to make the drills; but with the lazy-beds, as soon as the horse brings out the manure, it is spread and covered with the spade. And we must not forget, Mr. Editor, that this class of farmers comprises nineteen-twentieths of the farmers of Ireland. Again, Mr. Townsend"
"250  states that in the lazy-bed the seed is laid on the hard, unploughed ground, and that ""from the little depth penetrated, the moisture is soon dried up, and the plant languishes in drought."" The truth and fact is, that the ground is as carefully ploughed in this part of the country preparatory to lazy-beds as to drills. There is nothing at all in this argument."
"Again, it is stated that the drill-husbandman ploughs his land for oats in February or March, while the lazy-bed cultivator waits ""till the latter end of April or middle of May,” when, ""it is little softer than stone,” and "" worked into a brick."" Surely, sir, such an argument as that does not require an answer ? I am sure it was not intended it should get one."
"As to the letter signed ""A Scotchman,"" it seems to me to be written with a view of exalting his countrymen, at the expense of poor Paddy; and to do the latter about as much justice as I conceive the lazy-beds got in the letter on which I have commented."
"_ My own opinion, if it be of any value, is this—In a large farm (such as I suppose Mr. Towtisend holds), thorough-drained and subsoiled, with horse-work and labour at command, I would say that the drill-system is decidedly preferable, though I conceive that there are even here some peculiar advantages in lazy- beds. But in the case of a small farmer, with a limited quantity of manure, his land not thorough-drained and subsoiled (including perhaps 999 parts out of 1000 in Ireland), and mainly depending on his own labour and that of his family, I do believe that generally the lazy-bed system is more advantageous. There is this peculiar advantage in the lazy-bed, that it, in a great measure, supplies the place of subsoiling; and if, on potatoes being next set in the field, the trench be changed to what was the middle of the bed before, the subsoiling is almost complete. I have improved almost all my own fields, and cleared them of stones in this way; for subsoiling with the plough is so expensive as to have proved hitherto entirely out of the reach of small farmers. I have also observed, that after drill potatoes the undersoil becomes so hard and impervious from the frequent passing of the horses and plough over the surface, as to require the greatest difficulty in breaking it up. This I consider to be a very serious disadvantage. I apologize for troubling you, but have been led to do so from a desire to check a spirit of condemning whatever has the sanction of time.— :"

POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, March 7'"", 1846, page 732"
"We must repeat our warning, not to plant potatoes about which there is a doubt. It would be better to gamble in a lottery, or in Capel-court. Doubtless, in some instances, success will attend the risk—but whose will that success be? We cannot venture to say whose."
"O  How are we to know potatoes about which there is a doubt ? is the natural rejoinder. How, indeed ? THEY CANNOT BE KNOWN. The eye will not distinguish them; nor will the resources of chemistry, botany, or physiology, do anything in this matter. Even the microscope fails us. We have now examined diseased po- tato plants obtained from sets so apparently sound that we have entirely failed in discovering an unfavourable symptom; and we are irresistibly driven to the conclusion that, in such cases, the malady is /atent. That being so, we can no more determine whether the murrain is present in the potato, than whether gout or king’s evil are latent in a child; we must wait for time to make the discovery."
"But the production of food cannot be allowed to wait for the slow advance of time. We must have it at the moment we want it, or we starve. Therefore we say to the Irish people, PLANT NO MORE POTATOES FOR A SUSTENANCE."
"Sow your land with oats, or other grain. The natural kindness of your landlords will furnish you with the means of doing so, in this your great calamity. You cannot afford to gamble in the article of food. Certainty is indispensable in your case. Turn, then, to oats; they are a much better food than potatoes, and they can be relied upon. Potatoes are a lottery in which the prizes, when you win them, are not worth the having. It is, in any case, a shame to plant the most fertile land in Europe with the worst kind of food which the earth is capable of yielding; and, in the present conjuncture, it would be a wickedness to do so, when the danger that attends it is thus providentially discovered in good time."
"We formerly stated, upon the authority of government returns, that Gallicia and Corsica were, at that time, the only foreign countries in Europe from which a supply of perfectly sound potatoes could be obtained. Now that the importance of showing what districts are uninfected has become so much more apparent than then was, we hasten, with permission of government to make known the state of the potato disease in Scotland, some counties of which are, or were, seemingly exempt from the visitation."
"From this return it appears that in the synods of Aberdeen, Moray, Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, Glenelg, Orkney, and Shetland, the disease was, at the time of the returns to government—that is to say, early in November, either unknown altogether or nearly so. It may have since manifested itself in a small degree; indeed we know that in Sutherland and Caithness traces of it were discovered. Yet we think that in this our present difficulty the northern counties of Scotland offer the best resources within our reach. To these we will add the Calf of Man, where Mr. Shepherd's potatoes, concerning which we shall very soon have something more to say, are unaffected."
"But we must break off for the present with recommending to consideration a dissertation, just published, by Mr. Forsyth, on the potato disease, which is by far the best that has yet appeared among the pamphlets, although we are far from agreeing with the author in some of his views, and to which we shall hereafter refer more particularly."
252  ABSTRACT OF THE STATE OF TUB POTATO CROP IN SCOTLAND.
"[Just as we are going to press we have received a letter from Sir George Mackenzie, dated Roslin, Feb. 24, in which is the following dismal intelligence:— "" The potato disease has broken out in the north at last."" What could have retarded it there is a mystery.""|— Agricultural Gazette."
"POTATO SEED AND PLANTING Farmers Gazette, March 14"", 1846, page 743"
"Referring to an article headed "" Seed Potatoes,"" in your last Herald, / may remark that extensive field experience in Canada is much more satisfactory to farmers, than the small nursery experience of ""Lady Rolle's gardener"" or the "" orcing- houses of the Horticultural Society."" But we have not only the experience of Canada to show that affected sets grow; the reports made to Professor Johnston from different parts of Scotland show the same fact, as far as time has allowed."
"Observe : the question is nof,—whether will diseased sets grow healthy plants,—but whether will diseased sets yield a crop to pay the expenses of raising, and supply the wants of next season ? :"
"Almost ten years ago, I proved in your Herald that a crop free from the germ of disease cannot arise from sets constitutionally diseased, yet we often see diseased parents carry their offspring through several generations; and during the past twelve or more years, we have had the experience of diseased potatoes yielding crops varying in different places and in different seasons. During all this time, we have seen that warm, light soils tended to aggravate the disease and unfit the tubers for being sets, while cold, upland soils yielded sets more to be trusted. We always found that much heat and rapid fermentation in the soil tended to the failure of the crop. This is closely analagous to the facts stated with such emphasis by Dr. Lindley in your last. Lady Rolle's potatoes, be it observed, were planted in autumn, in Devonshire, in the warmest climate of England, where the disease first attacked the potatoes about last July, where the disease attacked the plants in the earliest stage of growth, where the ground was to an extraordinary extent defiled or infected with the poison of the disease, and where the winter was excessively mild. All these facts show that her ladyship's potatoes were in the very place and circumstances where disease might pre-eminently be expected; and that her case affords no index of what may be expected in the colder climate of Scotland, where the potatoes were ripe before the disease affected them, and where sets preserved well in winter are properly planted in spring."
"It is well known that plants have their period of hybernation or dormancy; they need the rest of winter as much as we need the rest of night. Autumn planting, in ordinary winters, may be the safest method of storing the sets of next year (as the cold of winter retards growth to the proper season); but in a mild winter like the past, and a mild climate like Devonshire, the plants had no period of winter-rest from growth, and being enfeebled by the phenomena of last season, it would have been wonderful if"
"O  they had not failed. Carry these facts to the hotbeds or ""forcing-houses of the Horticultural Society,"" and what is the inference ? Plants have failed in hot-houses in winter, ergo, they will not, after a winter's rest, grow in the open cool fields of Scotland in summer! But plants sometimes stood this forcing in former years. Well, we have only one or two cases of their failure in the present, and even if we had fifty cases of hot-house failure, we might meet them with five hundred cases of field- failure in former years, while, after all, the crop supplied, the wants of the country."
"I am certainly of opinion that the potato crop must, for some years, and till we have fresh seed from South America, be grown on a much more limited scale, and with much more caution, than in former years; still I think no facts as yet known warrant farmers to abandon altogether the expectation of a potato crop in the coming season, particularly as they can, as formerly, sow turnips where the potatoes fail."
"In the higher districts, where the most healthy sets formerly grew, the disease of last year did not appear till October, when the crop was about ripe, and long after the leaves had been destroyed by frost. The disease here made no progress after October 1 raised, in the middle of January last, ten drills left till then, and found appearances exactly similar in every respect to those in October. As nearly as could be estimated, the same proportion of sound and of affected tubers were raised. Several of the sound ones were cut in slices, examined by a lense, and showed no discolouration (even after exposure to the air) to indicate a condition different from that of former years. I opened a pit on Christmas day, and found the potatoes without the least heat (when compared by the thermometer with the soil near them), and to all appearance, when cut, as beautiful and sound as I could have wished. Since then I have not opened the pit."
"It would be unwise to plant any but the most sound-looking sets, from high grounds, and either cups or some of the varieties lately imported from South America. We may get part of seed from the north of Scotland, but in this farmers will be very liable to be imposed on, by sharpers pretending that potatoes are from quarters different from the truth."
"On warm, light soils I do think it hazardous to attempt potatoes this year. In such I certainly would not plant thorn on the dung, as formerly, but have the dung now in- timately broken at filling; spread it broadcast from the carts, plough it in, and leave the ground thus till about the middle of April; open the drills, and (if it can be had) spread in the bottom of the drills pulverized peat-mould, or ""peat-coom;” plant the middle sized uncut potatoes on this, cover them with the plough, and in other respects treat them as in former seasons. Peat was noted last season as a preserver of the crop. Dung in which diseased potatoes have been mixed is likely to propagate the disease."
"The desire for potatoes among all classes is so strong that, for a year or two, they will bring the price at which prudent farmers may be able to raise them; and the very impulse of price will induce enterprising men to secure us fresh varieties without delay —"

"Sir—tt is exceedingly difficult for a person with an opinion formed in favour of any particular system, to argue its merits as compared with another, in a spirit of unprejudiced impartiality; the recollection of early associations will force themselves upon the mind, with a strength often sufficient to bias the judgment, and make the person appear to others prejudicial, when in reality it is his utmost desire to be impartial in his arguments; and I would observe, that prejudice is as much shown, in"
"blindly following any system because it is new, as it is in obstinately adhering to’"
"another because it is old. In the accumulated experience of years, or of ages, better systems may arise, but a person should be well convinced of their merits, before he utterly discards all others, in a newly conceived predeliction for their use; there is ‘as much inconsistency in arguing that white is black, as there is in arguing that black is white."
"These remarks occurred to me on reading the letter of ""a Donegal Farmer,” in the last number of your GAZETTE; in his introduction he justly deplores the want of candour and liberality in the arguments of the opponents of the lazy-bed system, and yet it cannot be said that his own arguments are either very candid or liberal."
"Your correspondent describes a plan of putting down potatoes in ridges, on which I do not mean to remark at present, further than to say that it may be a very sound method, but is not the one most commonly practiced in this district, and I believe is oftener (though not always) had recourse to, by those farmers who wish to have their potatoes in the ground in “time enough” and to put out the manure at their convenience afterwards, than from any settled conviction of its supreme utility. One sentence I will however quote, in describing the process he says "" the land is made as clean and fine as if intended for drifls;"" now if we are to take his own description of the preparation for drills, it certainly does not differ, very materially from the methods so much denounced by your former correspondents, as the system of preparation used for the lazy-beds; and a stranger would be apt to say, ""these people are only beginning to use the drill cultivation, and think that the preparation which was formerly given to the land for lazy-bed culture, may likewise be quite sufficient for drills."" An intimate acquaintance with the district in the vicinity of Lifford, enables me to say that this is not the case, and that they generally prepare their land both for ridges and for drills, in a superior manner; and in their after cultivation, many of them are not excelled in any part of the kingdom. Indeed how could it be otherwise, for as your correspondent states, they are both active and intelligent; but how can they be so, if they are yearly extending a rude and ignorant method of drill cultivation, to the superseding of the one formerly in use, which according to your correspondents' arguments, ought to be infinitely preferred; but perhaps he only used this plan to throw the advocates of drill husbandry on the defensive, and to show that almost all their arguments which have hitherto been used against a bad system of lazy-bed culture, could with equal propriety be used against a bad system of drill husbandry, although his admission that it is nearly impracticable to get labourers to do the lazy-beds with care and expedition, gives the drill husbandry an advantage, if it were none other but in this respect."
"O  Where the active and intelligent farmers of a district are changing their system, are giving up a method of cultivation they have been accustomed to from their earliest infancy, and are adopting in its stead one which is comparatively new, and when this change is yearly increasing, there must be some cause."
"It has been found by farmers, that where wheat is to be sown (which is now most commonly done,) on the potato land, that it is impossible to get the ridges properly leveled, there always remains a degree of roundness, and the tops of the ridges being so much exposed to the frosty winds of winter are often thinned out so as not to be more than half a crop, or if the wheat be shovelled, the brows or edges of the ridges show the same fate, and the unequal depth and richness of the different parts of the ridge causes an inequality in the ripening, which is prejudicial to the quality of the grain. Again, where potato land is to be sown down with clover, it is found that it grows very unequally for the same reasons, and it will often miss both in the furrows, and in the middle of the ridge, the one from being too poor, and the other from being too loose; and it is no uncommon thing to see two strips on each ridge with a good bit of clover, while the middle of the ridge and the furrow have been complete failures. Again, where flax is to follow wheat, the unequal depth and richness of the soil are disadvantageous, one part perhaps being good productive flax, and the other of unequal length coarse and branchy. Again, when breaking up land for oats which has bean laid down after potato ridges, if it is ploughed in narrow ridges, the summer drought penetrates at the edges of these ridges, and the crop near them becomes stunted in growth; if it is ploughed in broad ridges, the surface retaining the form of the former ridges will be uneven, and unequal ripening will be the consequence. And I would here remark, that no matter what care be taken, the rich soil will find its way into the furrows, the plough and harrow will convey it there, and (here must consequently be a corresponding poorness and shallowness in the middle of the ridge, which is increased by the furrow being there, after the land is ploughed."
"I admit the advantages mentioned by your Magherafelt correspondent in favour of lazy-beds, but I think they are more than counterbalanced by the objections which I have here stated, none of which can be applied to drill cultivation; and I would request both him and a ""Donegal farmer,"" to give their opinion on these subjects, and to whether these objections are not relevant against the lazy-bed system, always supposing that both it and the drill system are properly and economically executed in all their details, for without this supposition, no proper comparison can be instituted."
"There are some undrained soils of so wet and retentive a character, that it would be impossible to cultivate potatoes in them in drills with profit, and on such soils ridges may very properly be had recourse to, as a temporary expedient for thorough draining; but it would be better and in the end more economical, if such soils were at once properly drained, and subjected to the usual routine of cultivation adopted on naturally dry lands."
"256  We are entering on a new era in agriculture, when whatever may become of ""high labour,"" “low wages"" will be unknown, abundance and cheapness of food have always had the effect, and will have the effect of withdrawing a portion of its supply from the labour market, and of rendering the remaining portion less dependant upon their employers for their subsistence, who will on these accounts have to pay more for their services; it is then to the adopting of better systems which may combine economy with efficiency and profit, that we are to look for a resource for the time to come; every system therefore, which is of doubtful utility, should be thoroughly sifted: if a better is to be found, let it be adopted, and if not, let every possible improvement on the former be carried into effect, and we should not despair, but we may yet be able to give higher wages to the labourer, and higher labour to the land, when we have before us the example of the British farmer, who has the authority of Professor Kane for saying, he can give double our wages, and yet be able to sell with us in the same markets—"

should you consider them worth notice for circulation.
"O  I have planted nearly 2 acres (soded) with the spade in ridges, about 4 feet wide. I commenced to plant the early ones in the latter end of January; which I have lately examined minutely, and I find they are all doing remarkably well—being all budded, nearly 2 inches long; remark, I planted them whole, using small seed, void of any taint, and laid them immediately on the manure, hot from the dung-pit, and covered them up. Some of the same kind I have cut, and I find they are not doing near so well; their buds are quite spindly, and the seed nearly rotten. I have tried some of the tainted potatoes, and they are completely rotted, I have even cut out ._ the diseased part out of some of them, but they have a small, exhausted bud, and will not come to any perfection, there being no substance in the seed left to support it."
"I would, from my own experience, advise potato growers to plant, if possible, all their potatoes whole—and immediately, on the manure, hot from the dung-pit and not to to be losing ground, by planting any of the diseased ones; for I have even tried them in hot-beds, some of which put forth buds, which died away when the seed rotted. The sooner the potato crop is got in this season the better, before the buds are removed that they first make, as the tuber, although apparently-sound, is more delicate this year than usual. I tried some that were disbudded, and many of them are putting forth a small, weak bud, while others are dying off, and some not budding at all."
"I would recommend lime to be scattered over the cut potatoes previous to planting, as I have lately discovered some insects which prove very injurious to the seed, by eating them through, and often cutting off their buds. I have tried scattering some newly-slacked lime over the seed, immediately after cutting them, and I find it has a good effect in arresting their progress, if not destroying these insects. Lime ought to be used where potatoes are cultivated, as it will sweeten the ground, and help to destroy insects—"

"SIR — I enclose, in a tin case, two stalks of early potatoes, for your inspection; first, to show the strength which they had attained when cut down by frost on the 6th of February; and, 2ndly, the manner in which the best shoots were produced below the part affected by the frost, and which may have been an inch into the earth. The two small potatoes sent were of the same size a month ago, and if not checked, would have been considerably larger before this time. I am sure the damage from frost might have been prevented or mitigated by due caution."
"The potatoes were of the purple kidney, and planted in October (about the middle)"

"[Having had proof of the strength and productiveness of autumn-planted potatoes, gave us confidence in recommending its adoption, at the time the outcry about the failure of them became so prevalent; and we are gratified ""The Knight of Kerry"" agrees with us in its importance. The specimens sent are very fine; and had they not received the check they did on the 6th of February and this other now, there is no doubt but a full crop might have been ready to raise in May, as the two largest tubers are nearly as large as pigeon's eggs. The efforts which the stems have made to push below where the frost has injured them is most astonishing, each shoot is two inches Jong, producing, of course at the root, a proportionate amount of aorils, which in tneir turn will, no doubt, form a greater number of tubers, and which, on the aggregate, will be smaller, but, from past experience in a similar case, we have no doubt the crop will be heavier than those planted in spring. We are obliged to the “Knight of Kerry” for the trouble he has taken in sending the roots and will be happy to lay before our readers the ultimate result of this experiment, if he will have the goodness to communicate it.]"

"Sir—On my being at Chapelizod last Thursday morning. Major Izod took me into his garden, and in one of his hot-houses showed me a long wooden box with potatoes growing in it."
"The Major told me, he had last November taken diseased potatoes of various sorts, quite black all over, and planted them in the box, and placed it in the hothouse for trial; the result is now that the stocks are very luxuriant, and coming into blossom. Major Izod ordered the gardener to raise two of the stalks to see what was under them, when there appeared to be both a plentiful and healthy progeny coming forward at the roots; the young potatoes were about the size of large marbles. One of the old potatoes partly was going to decay, the other old tuber appeared to be as sound as when planted; the potatoes were planted whole;— perceive the black potatoes are growing through the pits the same as the white ones."

O  THE POTATO CROP—SEED FOR THE NEW CROP (From the Edinburgh Magazine of Natural History.)
"Farmers Gazette, March 21°, 1846, page 764"
"MY DEAR SIR—Your letter, of the 21st November, was received by me on the 20th instant, together with the printed slips on the subject of the potato disease, which it appears has occasioned great alarm in various parts of Europe. The summer of this year has certainly been most unpropitious to the «cultivation of the potato, not only in your country but in this, for our later crop has proved to be of inferior quality, and the produce has been scant; and, in many places, the disease in ques- tion has affected the tubers in the manner described in the British publications on the subject. With us a wet and cold season is greatly injurious to this vegetable- Frequent showers, when the plant is immature, are beneficial, but, when the tubers approach to maturity, temperate and dry weather is necessary to bring them to perfection. Had the last summer with you not been extraordinary for the quantity of rain which fell, and the low temperature of the atmosphere, you would have had no reason to complain of the scantiness of your crops, or of the destruction occasioned by the wet. In Pennsylvania we have two crops of potatoes; those planted in the opening of the spring, intended for summer use, and those planted about the latter end of May. Our first produce this year was most excellent; but the latter crop, as I have stated above, is of very inferior quality, occasioned, it is said, by superabundant wetness when the tubers had received their full growth. In the list of your printed queries, it is asked, ""Do plants die out?"" ""Is the potato dying out? I would answer, that I know no instance of plants dying out, nor do I believe that the potato is dying out; and, should your next summer be exempted from superabundant rains, and be favoured with more genial heat than the last, all your investigations, chemical, botanical, and entomological, will be found to be superfluous. Your may even spare yourselves the trouble of sending to America for seed, your own being infinitely better than any which we could furnish you with. It takes many years for potatoes to become acclimated. Should you plant exotic tubers, it is probable that you would have no reason to be satisfied with the result. In Pennsylvania the most esteemed kind is known under the name of Mercer; some of these were planted at my instance, by Charles Watterton, Esq., at Walton Hall, in Yorkshire, a few years ago, but the produce was not considered equal to that of the English varieties. I once made the experiment of planting for three years successively, the Irish variety, called rose potato; every care was taken to promote success; a suitable soil and exposure were selected, and the ordinary tillage was attended to with exactness. The first year the produce was inferior to the seed as respected quality; the next year an evident deterioration had taken place as to the quality and quantity; and the third year the product was of so little value that it was cast to the hogs. During all the three seasons mentioned, my Mercer potato exhibited no change. The present year here is remarkable for another accident in the vegetable kingdom. The European walnut (Juglans regia) presented a great display of fruit in the month of June, but a caleopterous insect had deposited its eggs in the green nuts in such quantities that, at the usual period of maturity, the kernels were found to be entirely destroyed.

"PRICE OF POTATOES IN IRELAND Farmers Gazette, March 21°, 1846, pages 764-765"
"By order of the Honorable the House of Commons, a return has been issued of the highest price of potatoes in the various markets in Ireland, per bushel and stone, in the week ending the 24th day of January, for the last seven years (from 1840 to 1846 inclusively), as well as they can be ascertained."" Prom the printed copy of this return we subjoin a few random gleanings, which cannot but speak for the urgency of the position of our fellow-countrymen. The following figures, indeed are more eloquent than the most forcible rhetorical flourishing could be:—"
"(Note: the tables could not be scanned but show that in all areas the price in 1846 was lower than in 1840 —L,J.D.)"
"In a note to the official catalogue, the Inspector-General remarks:—"" It is represented, &c. that the present low prices in some instances are attributable to the anxiety of the farmers to dispose of their potatoes before they become diseased; others refer low prices to disease already commenced. In either case, the ultimate as well as the present effect must be most injurious. If immediate and active measures be not employed, we dread to reflect upon the futurity in store for Ireland."
ON THE LAZY-BED SYSTEM
"Farmers Gazette, March 28'"", 1846, page 778"
"siIR—I have read with considerable satisfaction the very mild and temperate observations of ""A practical farmer,"" contained in last weeks GAZETTE. The advo- cates of the lazy-bed system ought to congratulate themselves that they have at least one opponent who has the candour to admit that there are several important advantages to be derived from its practice, and who does not attribute it to"
"oO  “stupidity” or ""laziness,"" as some wiseacres have done, their adherance to a system which, under their peculiar circumstances, is probably the very best that could be adopted. Your correspondent admits the difficulty of weighing the arguments advanced against our own preconceived opinions, in a spirit of unprejudiced impartiality. To admit our own imperfections has always been considered a proof of superior wisdom; and it would be well if we would always remember that truth is the object of our investigations, and not the establishment of any particular opinion."
"Before replying to the arguments advanced by your correspondent, I would beg to correct a mistake he has inadvertently fallen into regarding the defective mode of cultivating drills, described in my last communication. I did not mean to insinuate that it was the general practice of the district; I merely wished to show that numbers who were adopting the drill system were not by any means the best farmers, and that it was just as easy to cultivate drills in a "" stupid, lazy, and indolent manner"" as it was ridges."
"I am of opinion the question—should the drill system be universally adopted by the Irish farmers—ought to be considered with reference to their means and the extent of their holdings. By a late statistical. account, it appears that there are 685,309 farms in Ireland, of this number there is 306,915, or nearly one-half under five acres in extent, 251,123 more or about five-sixths that are less than 15 acres, from 15 to 30, 78,954, and above 30 only 48,312 or about one in fifteen. Now I would ask the advocates of drill husbandry, what means has fourteen out of every fifteen of Irish farmers got to carry out the principles of their system, how are they to deepen and subsoil their land, and put down their drills ? Very few of them can afford to keep but one horse, and I cannot see how they are to proceed except upon the defective system I have already pointed out. They surely would not recommend them to drill them with the spade to save labour, for that would involve double the expense without any of the benefit of the ridge system."
"The next important consideration is the effects produced by each method cultivation upon the soil, and the succeeding crops. I readily admit that where wheat is to follow after potatoes, drills are generally found the best preparation, the reason for which, is, that it is thought to do best on firm bottom, but I fear that the firmness is the cause of permanent injury to the soil- The following sentences from professor’ Johnston's ""Elements of Agricultural Chemistry"" will illustrate what I mean:—"" There are certain substances contained in every soil, which gradually make their way towards the subsoil. They sink till they reach that point beyond which the plough, does not usually penetrate. Every farmer knows that lime thus sinks, and in peaty and sandy soils the clay thus sinks. If this be the case with substances not soluble in water, it will be readily believed that the saline ingredients of the soil will be sooner washed out of the upper soil, and conveyed to the under soil. Thus the subsoil may gradully become rich in those substances of which the surface soil has been robbed."" Now I would ask what other plan so simple, or so efficient, is within the means of the small farmer, for maintaining the necessary relation between the soil and subsoil, as the one he has adopted of subsoiling his potato land? Your correspondent observes that, in ploughing ridges for wheat, it is impossible to bring the ground to a level, or to distribute the rich earth evenly over the surface. Wow if he is really a practical farmer, he must be aware that these objections apply with equal force against his own system ; for, in ploughing drills,"
"262  the first four furrows are raised five or six inches above the level of the rest, while the ""hints"" or furrows are as much depressed below it, and are entirely stript of the rich earth ; while in the centre is collected double the quantity that is on any other part of the surface; and if it be a poor or shallow soil, the crop will be very uneven. But nothing is more easy than to bring the ground to a level and to distribute the rich earth over the whole surface, if you follow the plan I have laid down. If one furrow be taken off"" each brow of the ridge, and then plough the whole field across the ridges, the whole surface will be so level and even that scarce a furrow can be distinguished. The other objection, regarding the partial failure of flax and clover, is as easily disposed of. For the first few years, after I commenced farming, I did experience the results complained of; but after I had established a regular rotation of cropping, it has entirely disappeared; and the very best and finest flax I ever had was after potato ridges, cultivated exactly as I have recommended. In breaking up the land for oats, after lea, there is no necessity to plough the field in narrow ridges ; for if two be ploughed into one, they will form 15 feet ridges, which is a very convenient breath, neither will the ground be uneven afterwards."
"I have thus gone over the objections of "" A Practical Farmer, I would hope in a spirit of candour and impartiality ; and, in conclusion, would wish to impress upon the minds of land-stewards and agriculturists in general, the impolicy of wishing fo force any new system of cultivation upon the people, without the strongest evidence of its applicability to their peculiar circumstances, and also to the soil and climate. In proof of this, I would just refer to the fate of the Belgian system of flax cultivation lately introduced into this district. It is now completely extinct; and, like "" the baseless fabric of a vision,” has left nota trace behind. I would wish it to be here understood that I am no enemy to drill husbandry on the larger class of farms; I consider it the most suitable and economical, but it must be connected witha system of periodically deepening the soil, or the fertilit of they land will soon be seriously injured. I could point out many farms on which the old and imperfect mode of drilling has been long practised that are now ""run down,"" and will never recover their fertility until the crust is broken up and the intimate union that formerly existed between the soil and subsoil be again established."
"Hoping the above observations will satisfy all practical farmers, I remain,"
"Yours, &c, A DONEGAL FARMER, March 17th, 1846."
POTATO SEED
"Farmers Gazette, April 4'"", 1846, page 795"
"Sir--I find in your GAZETTE of the 21st instant, at page 702 that a letter written by Mr. Garden, of Dumfries, &c., he gives a great deal of good advice; but there are some parts of his letter that contain theory which would almost make people afraid to plant potatoes, as he thinks that all our fields are infected by the poisonous effluvia that arose from the potato fields last season. I tried a few experiments that showed plainly that there is no infection in the soil of this neighbourhood, though"
"CG  there were many of our fields which had plenty of rotten potatoes ; and in one of the fields where the potatoes were diseased last year, I planted it over again in October and November; the seed was cut and dusted with lime; they are now coming over ground, and are as fine and strong as any I have ever seen. The seed seems to be as the day it was planted. Although all my seed was clhosen from a heap, in which about one-third ivci'e either entirely rotten or very biadly diseased. Mr. G. thinks that if a stem has any of its tubers diseased, all the rest must be more or less diseased also. I laid some of that description by themselves, and planted some, and find them to be all good. I planted some ash-leaved kidneys, last November, on a hotbed where there was a lively heat but not a burning one. I cut some diseased potatoes of the blue kidney kind, and put them between the rows of the sound ones, and some in contact with them; the result of this experiment was that all the diseased sets became rotten in a short time; and although some were laid close to the sound ones they did them no harm. I planted potatoes early in February, this year, on land where most of the crop rotted last season, and they are doing well and no sign of being infected. I put down some diseased sets near them, and I find they are declining. If the eye of a diseased potato be middling sound, it will certainly push a bud; but it is very apt to fail afterwards: therefore, a diseased potato should not be depended upon by any means."
"About five months ago, I put a cwt. of potatoes into a small cask in a shed and covered them; they were nearly half sound and half diseased, as near as I could guess; I opened the cask on this day and found that almost all of the diseased tubers were nearly melted down through the sound ones I find they have done the sound potatoes no harm; for after folding some of them I found they had not the least taint, which proves beyond any doubt that it was not an infectious rot, unless where there would be a great fermentation, or where the sound ones were too much overpowered by rotten ones. I tried another experiment that removes all doubts about infected earth. About three weeks ago I cut some potatoes of different varieties, I then went to where there was a heap of rotten pinkeyes, I removed them, and then laid the sets with the cut side downwards. On examining these, I find they are making strong shoots, and are as sound as the day they were put in that very dangerous place of trial; for as the man who was with me at the time said, it was a very unfair trial to lay the cut sets on the site of where about 5 cwt. of potatoes rotted into a black mass. I have as much confidence in any potato that is sound in appearance this year as any other, nor would I care if it was taken from beside a dozen of diseased tubers, as I am strongly of opinion, that any tuber that has kept well till now, does not contain one particle of the prevailing disease of the last season; I am also of the opinion that there is not a trace of the fungus that injured the tubers last year now in existence, either in the soil or elsewhere. If we can get seed from places where there was no distemper it will be more satisfactory, but where that cannot be accomplished we may safely plant our own. We cannot be deceived in the appearance, as any potato, as far as I have seen yet, was externally attacked; other diseases began at the core, but the disease of last year did not, as the inside is the very last part that breaks down, let no one be afraid to plant potatoes because they failed last year, for such another season may never return."
I hear of many failures after the autumn planting; I think they may be attributed
"264  to too much wet in the ground or to diseased seed, that was planted without a close examination, to see whether all was right or not. The failures of the hotbed potatoes in England, I think, may be attributed to diseased seed. A little too much heat will destroy the very best potatoes; and the heat that would grow a sound potato would destroy a diseased one; for the heat that would help a diseased seed to vegetate, would fail either in a very cold or a very warm climate. I would be sorry: to offend Mr. Garden, but I would like to know how he can show that the old set could infect the tuber on the rose end; for I cannot conceive how the old set could do any harm. I am also surprised how the disease could attack the tubers in the bottom end in England, and on the rose end in Scotland. :"

THE LAZY-BED SYSTEM
"Farmers Gazette, April 4°"", 1846, page 795-796"
"siIR—I am glad to see by your last GAZETTE that a Donegal farmer has resumed the discussion, on the comparative merits of the drill and lazy-bed systems of cultivating potatoes, the legitimate end of all controversy is to arrive at truth, and when a discussion is carried on with this view, the statement of opposite opinions has a tendency to elucidate the right, and to expose the wrong; I hope, therefore, you will bear with me a little, while I endeavour again to advocate the drill, in preference to the ridge cultivation of potatoes"
"On looking over your correspondent's letter I find that he is more annoyed at the system being called ""stupid, ignorant,” &c., than at any arguments which have been advanced against it; now I would submit to his consideration, that if the system be a good one, railing it by hard names cannot materially detract from its usefulness, and if the system is bad it surely cannot be wrong to call it by its right name. :"
"Your correspondent has, I observe, slightly changed the bearing of the subject, I had thought that we were discussing which was the best method of cultivating potatoes, whether in drills or in ridges, but the statement which I now see before me is, ""Should the drill system be universally adopted by Irish farmers;""—In his former letter he says, that he had tried it for seven years and had not found any advantage from it: in this letter he says, that he considers it most suitable and economical, on the larger class of farms; now, by the statistics which he has quoted, it appears that there are 306,915 farms in Ireland under 5 acres each, taking these at an average of 3 acres each, it would give in this class 920,745 acres; there are 251,128 farms between 5 and 15 acres, taking these at an average of 10 acres each, it would give in this class 511,280 acres; there are 78,954 farms between 15 and 30 acres; these at an average of 22 acres, it would give in this"
"O  class 1,776,465 acres; being altogether 5,208,490 acres in farms under 30 acres each; now by the census of 1831, the number of cultivated acres in Ireland was 14,608,473, exclusive of mountains, bogs, and lakes, this would leave 9,394,983 acres for the remaining 48,312 farms, or at the rate of 193 acres for each farm: if to this we add 1,776,465 acres held by farmers of from 15 to 30 acres, and who would certainly be entitled to keep one horse each, it would make the amount 11,171,449 acres held by farmers who possessed all the requisites for drilling their land, and to whom consequently it would be the most suitable and economical method, which will show that supposing that the ridge system were most-beneficial for the remaining portion, it would not amount to one-fourth of the cultivated land in Ireland; and from this quantity it is but fair to state, that at least one-third ought to be deducted which is held by merchants, mechanics, and tradesmen, who do not labour their land themselves, but who employ hired labour, and to whom the cheapest, best, and speediest method is a matter of some consequence, and who will, therefore, employ the drill system as the best means of attaining this end; it may be said that a farmer with one horse cannot drill his land; true, neither can he plough it, or prepare it for ridges without the assistance of his neighbour, but that does not imply that the system is defective, or that the work will be worse executed than if the two farms had been in the possession of one person; and, I would beg to state, that so convinced are the farmers in this neighbourhood of the superiority of drill culture, that persons who do not hold land sufficient to keep horses, often drill with the spade in preference to putting down their potatoes in ridges; the farmer who last year gained the Royal Agricultural Society's premium for potatoes, turnips, and clover, in the Strabane Farming Society, cultivated both his potatoes and turnips in drills with the spade, and it could not be said that he did so with the view of getting the premiums, as he was not a member of the society, nor had it been in connection with the Royal Agricultural Society at the time that his crops were put in the ground."
"Were the present state of Ireland a flourishing one, it would be fair to argue this question with reference to the present condition of Irish farmers; but when we see a system of cultivation acknowledged on all hands to be bad, existing for a great length of time contemporaneously with the lazy-bed culture, we are forced to come to the conclusion, that this is not the system which is to elevate Irish agriculture, or the Irish agricultural labourer, otherwise, it must have produced these effects long before now."
"The condition of Ireland with respect to labour is anomalous; the supply of labour is super-abundant, and, yet, the land is very far from being well cultivated. Mr. Griffith, in his evidence before the House of Commons, slates, that the land in Ireland is very far from being sufficiently cultivated, and, yet, by the returns of the commissioners for ascertaining the average duration of agricultural labour, it appears that in the whole of Ireland each labourer only gets 22 weeks employment during the year, and is, consequently, 30 weeks in the year idle. I consider that the lazy-bed system has in a great measure arisen out of this superabundant supply of labour, as, were agricultural labourers employed as they ought to be, it would be impossible to get hands to do the work in sufficient time. To farmers who keep a large number of cottiers on their lands, and give them 22 weeks work in the year, it may be possible to"
"266  call in extra hands at a time, and to pay them not in money, but in house rent, and potato land, and to suffer them to exist for the remaining part of the year as they best can; this may be a convenient arrangement for farmers, but it is one which is degrading the labourer, even below the scale which he ought to hold in civilized society; it does not do for a man who is dependent for his daily bread upon his daily labour, to work thus by fits and starts, neither will he be able to do so good a day's work for the farmer, as if he were regularly employed and regularly fed during tihe whole year; there should be a system made in the labour department, so that the amount of labour in each season would correspond as nearly as possible with the number of labourers required constantly on the farm."
"Your correspondent I see agrees with me that drills are the best preparation for wheat, but is afraid that he may thereby permanently injure the soil, by washing the saline ingredients of the surface soil into the sub-soil. Now I might ask, does not this washing process take place as well when the land is in ridges as when in drills? yes; but says a Donegal farmer, you can subsoil your furrows when the land is in ridges, and thereby maintain the necessary relation between soil and subsoil; now, to this it might be replied, so you can subsoil your land, and much more effectually too, while it is preparing for drills; and the question would then be, which is the cheapest and most effectual method. I would likewise call your correspondent's attention to the fact, that drill cultivation has been carried on for a very long time in Scotland and some parts of England, without at all experiencing tie results which your correspondent seems to dread; sub-soiling, there, is but a very recent invention, and, although the effects from it have been great, still it has been sufficiently proved, that drill cultivation could be carried on for an indefinite length of line without at all producing the results complain of."
""" A Donegal Farmer "" likewise found flax and clover not to answer well on land which had been in potato ridges ; but that, after he had adopted a regular rotation, he did not find these failures to take place. I am glad to hear of this, as the consequences of adopting a regular rotation, as ! consider this to be the foundation of all good farming; but, certainly, it requires some stretch of the imagination to conjecture the reason why a field which has been well manured and well cultivated should produce such different results, merely because it had not previously been under a regular rotation. Your correspondent says, that it is quite as easy to make the ground level after ridges as after drills. Kow I cannot yet see how it could be the case, that a deep trench, 18 inches broad, on every 7i feet, could be filled up, without robbing the other parts of the land, as easily as a shallow furrow on every 15 or perhaps 30 feet could be filled up; and, at the risk of being considered not a practical farmer, I must say that I cannot understand it. That land may be ploughed in the method he directs, I admit: but that it will produce the results he anticipates, without thinning the high parts of the ridge, is what I cannot comprehend."
"The advice which your correspondent gives to land-stewards and agriculturalists they would do well to act upon; for if a man is not convinced of the utility of any new system, it is rare that he will do it justice if he is forced to adopt it; but the sure proofs that a system is suited to the district is, when it is progressively increasing among the thinking part of the community."
"GU  The allusion made to the Belgian system was as uncalled for in the present controversy as it is unfortuate for your correspondent's arguments. If that system was wrong, it seems it has soon ceased to be practiced; while the system which he is at present arguing against, he admits, is annually extending. But is it really the case, that the Belgian system has become extinct in this neighbourhood ? A part of the system, it is true, has been superseded by the introduction of improved machinery ; but surely a person living ia the vicinity of Lifford cannot but be aware, that many of the methods introduced by the Belgians are still practiced by many farmers in this district— such as turning on the grass, rippling 1he seed, &c. ; and Mr. Galbraith's ‘establishment, in Lifford, is still carried on under the charge of his Belgian superintendant, where flax is prepared and finished for the Belfast, English, and Scotch markets."
"I hope ""A Donegal Farmer "" will not forget to give his promised statement of the comparative expense of cultivating lazy-beds and drills."
"Apologizing for the length to which this letter has run, I remain,"

EDITORIAL
"Farmers Gazette, April 11°, 1846, pages 808-809"
"THE question whether there will, or will not, be a crop of potatoes in 1846, has been repeatedly agitated of late, and is still as dubious as ever. One learned professor, justly celebrated for his contributions to the science of botany, has already given forth his verdict in no unhesitating terms that the potato crop of the current year is doomed to destruction, and that even in the first stages of its growth, ere the tubers have begun to form, disease will manifest itself. A host of other writers, following in the wake of Professor Lindley, have also sounded the tocsin of alarm—all resting their arguments on the fact, that potatoes, growing in frames and early borders, have already manifested the disease in the shape of a brown eschar or gangrene, both in the stems and tubers, which either kills the plant prematurely, or renders the produce unfit for keeping or propagating itself in a healthy manner. How far such reasonings may apply in reference to the general field crop of the country, remains yet to be proved. Many theories and specious arguments announced with no little parade of learning, at the period when the potato disease first appeared, have now been, by the experience which time teaches, found to be incorrect; and so, also, we doubt not, will many of the gloomy forebodings which some writers have indulged in, regarding the new potato crop, turn out, when time has unfolded the events of' the next six months. There is, without doubt, good reason for exercising the utmost caution as respects the treatment of the crop in its different stages of growth; but we see none for despair: and while, on the one hand, it would be wrong to abandon altogether the cultivation of the potato, merely because disease has already done some little mischief, no less would it be hazardous to plant the seed in the manner usually adopted. If we can"
"268  succeed in growing a comparatively healthy crop, by refraining from all attempts at forcing with nature, the potato ‘plant may, in a few years, recover its pristine vigour; and even, although an epidemic may threaten us in the autumn months of the present year, similar to what occurred at a corresponding period last year, the crop may be saved from its ravages by prompt and active measures."
"Most of the epidemics which attack the vegetable, as well as the animal, kingdoms, have generally first made their appearance either on the Continent of Europe, or still farther east in Asia, their progress being from east to west; so that, if an epidemic similar to what occurred last year, should break but in these eastern countries, we can forestall its approach, and prevent it from doing much injury to our potato fields, either by raising the crop at once,- or breaking the communication between the atmosphere and the tubers, by cutting down the stems.- It is an undoubted fact that wherever the crop had been raised last year, or the stems had become withered, and the cellular tissue ceased to perform its functions, that the crop was free from disease. One instance with which we were made acquainted, proves the truth of the statement, that had all the stems been out down before the disease manifested itself, the whole of last year's crop of potatoes might have been saved. A farmer raised a few cart- loads of unripe potatoes from a field about three or four weeks before the disease appeared. These potatoes remained perfectly sound and free from taint all winter; whereas, those on the other part of the field—which had been allowed to remain in the field until after the disease had become general— were almost totally destroyed by it. This fact leads us to conclude, that there is no inherent disease in the potato itself; and also, that we may be able, in future, to guard against the ravages of epidemics by adopting the means above suggested."
"With respect to the crop of this year, there are certain points connected with the planting of the seed which demand no ordinary attention in order that it may have a chance of growing and reaching a healthy maturity. The fields most injured by disease last year, were either those which were naturally very rich, or had received a heavy manuring. 1st. Injudicious forcing of the crop appears, therefore, to have been one of the predisposing causes of disease. Let this error be avoided, and only such a quantity of well-rotted dung he applied to the crop, as will be necessary to give a healthy—not redundant, growth to the plants. 2nd. Contact with decomposing manure has already been found, this spring, to have injured the vitality of the seed, by inducing a corresponding condition in the cut surfaces, and, afterwards, by transmission to the whole set: hence, planting immediately under or above the dung, without some separating material, should be avoided as much as possible. 3rd. Want of a free circulation of air, in consequence of the stems being over-luxuriant in many cases last year, aggravated the disease. Plant wider, therefore, than usual. 4th. Above all, use whole potatoes for seed, in preference to cut sets, and only such as appear to be sound."
"The planting of shoots has been recommended by several individuals, and deserves a trial. The Rev. J. L. Chute has, in the Cork Constitution, advocated this mode in preference to sets or tubers, and more recently he has brought the subject forward at a public meeting, held under the auspices of Matthew Browne, Esq,., in the town of Roscommon. The plan is well worthy of being fairly tried among others, but must not be entirely relied on for the general crop. ;"
6tf i.)
"O  In connection with these precautions, and as the means of diminishing loss from the crop failing, plant only one-half, or less, the usual quantity of potatoes you have been in the custom of doing, and cultivate instead Swedes, Aberdeen, yellow bullock, carrots, parsnips, or mangel-wurzel. These crops are scarcely so edible to human beings as potatoes, but they are far more certain; and so long as the prices of butcher-meat, butter and cheese continue good, the feeding of cattle, cows, sheep, and pigs will prove more profitable than growing potatoes exclusively for sale."
"Before concluding these remarks, we would throw out a few hints as, to the time and manner of planting potatoes. The sooner the crop is got in the better, provided the ground be in a proper state for it. The ground should be cool and moderately moist, and a day selected for planting when the atmosphere is in the same condition. If in drills, make them deeper than usual, spread-the manure thinly and evenly along the bottom, cover it up completely, with earth, from the crests of the drills, then drop the seed, if whole potatoes be used, at intervals of from fifteen to eighteen inches, and if cut sets at ten or twelve inches apart in a lineal direction. Take care to have all the eyes directed upwards in order that the shoots may rise perpendicularly, and not become twisted by being placed under the sets; then split the drills as deeply as the horses can, draw the plough, so as to drain off the water, and thus prevent all injury to the sets from this source. If cut sets be used, apply gypsum to the lacerated surfaces in order to form a crust and prevent, as much as possible, injury either from atmospheric causes, or from the decomposing influences of soil and manure. If the slightest taint of disease be suspected in potatoes intended for seed, adopt the plan recommended in a late number of the GAZETTE, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Garden, of Glenae, to dip the sets in water slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid, and afterwards dry it up with hot lime. Great caution is necessary if this plan be adopted; and before doing so, we would recommend a careful perusal of the article referred to. In planting potatoes in lazy-beds, cover the dung from the side trenches with two or three inches of soil, then plant the seed in rows across the beds eighteen inches apart, and about the same distance between the sets in a lineal direction, If whole, and a little closer if cut. Plant only a few rows at a, time, and cover the sets as quickly as possible with earth. The after-cultivation of the crop requires no particular remark; frequent stirring of the surface soil, thorough extirpation of weeds, and moderate earthing up, are all that the crop requires."
"It may be as well to abstain from all applications to the potato crop of nitrogenized manures, such as the different kinds of guano, whether imported or artificial, either in the shape of top-dressings or otherwise: this recommendation proceeds on the principle of not forcing the plants by highly-concentrated manures. Purely mineral manures may, however, be used with advantage, and may assist in giving tone to the plants. Epsom salts (sulphate of magnesia) seems to be as essential to the potato plant as phosphate of magnesia is to the seeds of corn; and it may therefore be employed with good effect in conjunction with nitrate of soda. Burnt bones dissolved in sulphuric acid, and thickened with soda or pearl ash, will also form a good manure for raising a healthy crop of potatoes."
We will thank our correspondents for any suggestions on this subject that may be useful to the public.

It recurred the second year in Canada; the safest course is to use every precaution which past experience has suggested; and if it shall turn out that J. M. has involved thousands of his fellowmen in famine and ruin by the heedless practice which his letter encouraged, he has dared a fearful responsibility. ;"
"It is quite possible that my letter may have been likely to mar the prospect of some who hoped to pocket a high price for seed potatoes grown on low warm soils. It is the interest of such ""gentlemen"" to laugh at my cautions and be witty over my words."

"O  EXPERIMENTS ON PRESERVING POTATOES, CONDUCTED IN THE GLASNEVIN BOTANIC GARDEN, WITH REMARKS ON PARISITICAL FUNGI IN GENERAL"
"A PAPER READ AT THE EVENING MEETING OF THE ROYAL DUBLIN SOCIETY, ON . THE 14TH INST., BY SIR. DAVID MOORE."
"Farmers Gazette, April 18, 1846, page 822-823"
"IN bringing forward this subject, so fully discussed already by men eminent for their scientific and practical acquirements, it is not to be expected that much additional information can now be afforded. But when its national importance is considered, with the large share of public attention which it continues to engross, and particularly as we have now arrived at that period when the effects produced on the potato crop of last year are fully known, and forebodings of the worst description rife, relative to the fate of the crop of the present season, I trust I need make no further apology for detailing the results of a series of experiments, conducted in the Botanic Garden during the past winter."
1st. On preserving potatoes.
"2nd. On the prospect of potatoes partially diseased being fit to use for seed ; and, 3rd. Whether the fungus which has appeared so uniformly on diseased potatoes is capable of extending itself to sound tubers when brought into contact with it."
"The experiments were commenced on the 29th of October last, and continued to the ist of the present month, when the results which I now purpose detailing were observed to have taken place."
"With a view of ascertaining what effect the drying process would produce, we selected four tubers partially diseased, and one sound, which were steeped an hour in water mixed with fresh lime, and then put into a large flower-pot, on the cool end of the flue of a stove, where the temperature ranged between 55 and 60 degrees of Fahrenheit. The diseased tubers soon collapsed, and produced fungi in the course of three weeks, after which they continued to dry up into a hardened mass. The sound tuber remained quite fresh, and was not infected with the fungus, although the others were placed over and under it."
"An equal number of tubers, in the same state, were subjected to similar treatment, after being dusted with fresh lime, which appeared to produce no different effect. The diseased potatoes shrivelled up, and decayed quite as soon as those which were neither steeped nor dusted."
"In these experiments, I would beg to observe, that the tubers were exposed to the light, and not covered with any kind of mould; but duplicates of the several lots were treated in a similar manner, when covered with earth, which had only the effect of keeping them longer from shrivelling. The diseased tubers decayed, and left the sound ones without being infected as before."
"A large garden potful, about one half sound and the other half diseased, as they were dug out of the earth, afforded similar results."
"272  We next tried them on the shelves of a seed-room, where they were circumstances in some degree similar to being placed on lofts. Four diseased and two sound tubers were put together, after being steeped an hour in lime and water; two of the diseased dried up into a hardened mass, two partially so, but were putting out strong buds. Those originally sound remained quite perfect. The same number un-steeped were similarly treated, but the diseased were not pushing forth buds when examined. Along with these were duplicates covered with mould, which merely had the effect of keeping the potatoes longer fresh. :"
"We next tried packing in the following drying materials, namely, powdered charcoal, turf-mould, and dry sand. Six tubers, placed in charcoal, two sound, two slightly diseased, and two considerably diseased; and after remaining five months covered up they appeared as follows:—Those much diseased quite decayed; those slightly ‘ diseased, apparently as sound as when put in, and pushing forth strong shoots, the sound still remained so, but had not pushed their buds so forward as the others. The duplicates placed in sand and turf-mould exhibited similar results."
"In a damp cellar, six potatoes, all diseased, were placed in dry sand, after being steeped an hour in lime and water, out of which four remain nearly as they were when put up, two have decayed into a putrid mass. Out of a large potful, half sound, half diseased, as they were dug from the field, and placed in dry sand without steeping, a few have decayed into soft putrescence, without producing any bad effects on those which were sound, which remain strong and healthy. I did not find that charcoal or bog-mould preserved them better than sand; in each parcel, those that were much diseased when put up had decayed."
"The next experiment |! consider to be fraught with considerable interest. It was first suggested, I believe, by Mr. Leland Croswaithe, one of the members of the Botanical Committee—to ascertain the effect of cutting off the diseased parts, before storing. The tubers operated on were those of the Apple variety, and out of twenty which were considerably diseased, only two have decayed. Ten were put up in dry sand, and ten in turf-mould, after being steeped an hour in lime and water. The two which decayed were covered with sand. Those in the turf-mould continued sound."
"The last experiment in preserving was to leave every alternate drill undung in the open ground, after putting a sufficient quantity of mould over them to preserve them from frost; and the results, in this instance, have been very remarkable. The tubers, both sound and diseased, remain, to all appearance, precisely as they were last October. The decay does not appear to have progressed, even in the partially diseased tubers; the only change which has taken place is in the cuticle, which has become cracked, and presents fissures similar to those which occur in some sorts of apples. Several of them were pushing forth strong buds when examined."
"The probability of the crop of the present season being infected by planting partially diseased seed has now become the most important inquiry; and, with a _ view of obtaining some information on this point, a quantity of Apple potatoes were selected, and divided into three classes—those that were apparently sound, a second portion slightly diseased, and a third more so. Of the first class, four tubers"
"O  were planted, one of them divided into two halves, which have produced ap- parently healthy plants. An equal number of the sound class produced three plants, two of which became sickly, when about eight inches over the surface, and wore evidently decaying. In examining the lower portion of the stems, they were found to be getting into a putrid state, close to the old tubers, but no fungi had appeared on the backs of the leaves; the third plant remains apparently healthy, but weak. None of the third class produced plants; but, on examining the mould, a few small, misshappen young tubers were found to have been produced by one of the sets. I ought to state that the whole was steeped an hour in lime and water before being planted. Duplicates were planted without being steeped, which gave nearly similar results. I have, however, observed, within the last week, that the leaves of one of the plants raised from a diseased tuber, has become infected with the fungus, Botrytis infestans, the same species which was so general on the leaves of diseased potatoes last season."
"Cup potatoes were classed in the same manner, and two tubers of each planted. The sound tubers have produced sound plants; those partially diseased produced plants very weak, and out of the two that were most diseased, one produced a plant, the lower leaves of which have been affected with the fungus, and it is otherwise very weakly."
"Two tubers, partially diseased, of the pink-eye variety, were planted, after dividing one of them, separating the rose from the root end, which produced two plants, one from the whole tuber, and one from the rose end of the cut tuber: they are both strong and coming into bloom. A few of the tip's of the lower leaves of one of the plants have shrivelled, on which the Botrytis has been observed."
"The last experiment was made on three diseased tubers—one of each of the varieties of potato I have already noticed. They were cut in halves and allowed to dry on the flue, until the cuts were healed over before being planted, but none of them has produced planis."
"To ascertain whether the, fungus, which has prevailed so generally on rotting Potatoes, infected sound tubers when a few only were put together, large pots were filled with potatoes, some sound and others in various stages of disease. The lots were placed together in dry and moist situations, when the diseased tubers, soon decayed into a soft putrid state, without, in any instance infecting those that were sound, although in close contact with them."
"Such were the experiments I considered advisable to conduct, with their results; and, although made on a small scale, the inferences deductible from them are not devoid of interest to the practical agriculturalist."
"In the first place, it appears that diseased tubers, exposed to a dry, warm atmosphere, decayed much quicker than those subjected to any of the other modes of treatment."
"Secondly, that diseased tubers placed on shelves in a cool room, but exposed to"
"atmospheric changes, decayed sooner than their duplicates which were, in the same house, but covered with mould."
"274  Thirdly, that diseased tubers placed in a dry cellar, where the temperature was low and uniform, kept much better than those which were in drier media."
"Fourthly, that where the affected parts were cutoff diseased tubers, and then steeped in lime and water, they have not decayed nearly so much as when left whole."
"Fifthly, that Potatoes left in the ground have not decayed further than they were last; November."
"Sixthly, that sound Potatoes have kept as well as in ordinary seasons. In reference to plants produced from different states of the tubers—"
"1. Those that were much diseased decay quickly when placed under the influence of heat and moisture, and do not produce plants."
"2. Those slightly diseased are liable, to fail, and the plants produced are weaker than those from healthy tubers; and, further, that they are liable to become affected on the lower portion of the stem, and decay."
"3. Sound tubers produce, apparently, sound plants."
"4. Cup Potatoes, though slightly diseased, are not so liable to fail as some others inthe same state, though the produce of such is not so healthy, nor strong, as those of sound tubers."
5. Steeping in lime and water appears to have had very little effect.
"Now, I am inclined to infer from these facts, that the decay which has taken place among stored potatoes, has not been caused by the disease progressing, but rather from the effect it produced last autumn, and the manner in which they have been stored. !t is well known, that large quantities of potatoes, heaped together, always produce a slight heat, which, as a matter of course, would be increased by the decaying material of the diseased tubers to a degree, it is reasonable to suppose, that would prove injurious to the whole heap, especially if many of them were infected. Indeed, one instance is recorded by Professor Henslow of sponta- neous combustion being nearly generated by a heap of decaying potatoes. When the heaps have been attended to, and occasionally turned over, having the diseased tubers picked out, I believe they have kept as well as they usually do, without further trouble."
"It is apparent that much of the success of this year's crop depends on selecting sound seed; for, although diseased tubers vegetate and produce plants, they are mostly weak, and certainly, liable to decay; and very many of them will fail if used, because it is to be observed, that the conditions necessary for active vegetation are precisely those conducive to putrefaction, which may become too powerful for the vital force to resist, before the young shoot has increased sufficiently to be independent of the old tuber for support."
"With reference to the decay which has already manifested itself this season, I am"
"not prepared to offer a decided opinion as to whether it is the result of last year's disease, or a modification of it: but in most of the cases which came under my"
"ie)  observation, from plants raised in the garden, as well as those sent to me from the country, the decay is clearly traceable to the old tuber. it takes place on the lower portion of the stem, generally close to the tuber. In some of the worst cases, I could not observe that the Botrytis had been produced on the leaves, but in two instances it was very evident, and agreed in every way, with the specimens collected last season by the Rev. Mr. Berkley, and kindly communicated to me. In such eases, however, had sound seed been used, it is probable that we should have had no appearance of disease."
"This leads me to offer a few remarks on parasitical fungi, which are destructive to agricultural plants. Those who have attended to the subject must be aware that some of the most distinguished investigators of the cause of the potato disease, consider this minute mould, Botrytis infestans, to have been the immediate cause of the murrain of last year, and, no doubt, it has very generally accompanied it both in this country and on the Continent. Its appearance on diseased plants, this season, is, therefore, the more remarkable. I can, however state with confidence that two of the plants on which I have observed it, were diseased long prior to the appearance of the fungus on the leaves; consequently, if the mould were the cause, the spawn producing it must have affected the plant at a very early stage of its growth, and proceeded from the root in place of the stem."
"The- Rev. Mr. Berkley has accompanied his interesting memoir, on the potato murrain, with a beautiful series of microscopical drawings, showing how this muscedinous plant grows extending its filamentous spawn under the cuticle of the leaf, and shooting up singly, or in fecicles, through the apertures of the stomates, thereby obstructing the admission of air, and the emission of perspiration, besides preventing the plant from elaborating . nutritive sap in the leaves."
"Although I still consider the mould only an accompaniment of the disease, I am well aware of the vast devastation such minute plants are capable of producing on the tissue of the larger vegetables. The ravages of mildew, smut, and bunt, are well known, and afford familiar instances. The dry- rot—which was formerly such a dreadful pest in rotting the timbers of ships and buildings, caused by the growth of Merulias lachrymans—is another, but happily it has been, to some extent, subdued since the process of steeping timber in certain saline and acid mixtures became general."
"These parasites, further, are particular in selecting the victims for their attacks, and confine themselves in most instances, either to a single species, or to those of a genus; but occasionally, the same species of parasite is found to grow on many of the plants belonging to one natural family, and the conditions necessary for their development are so peculiar as to preclude the possibility of effectually guarding against them. The spores or seeds are so numerous, that if those produced from a single head of diseased grain were all to vegetate they would be sufficient to infect whole district; and I believe there are few fields of wheat ever found effectually free from them; but as these minute spores depend so entirely"
"276  on peculiar atmospheric conditions for development, it is probable that one out of every million will not vegetate in the same season, in which they are produced, though like the seeds of some of the larger vegetables they may if favourably circumstanced, remain dormant for of time, until the conditions essential to it do occur, when they will appear in quantities, as we occasionally find to be the case. It is not well known how the spores gain access to the vegetable tissue, but Doctor Greville, of Edinburgh, whose knowledge of the fungi is so accurate and extensive, has lately expressed an opinion, that they may at all times inhabit the tissue of those species of plants to which they are respectively peculiar, without, under ordinary circumstances, deranging the vegetable functions, in the same manner as minute parasites infest different parts of the animal structure. A good opportunity occurred casually in the Botanic Garden of affording data to judge of the fearful consequences of the corn fungi when no means are used to check them. In cultivating small samples of so many of the different kinds of the cereal grains as we could procure, constantly on"
"_the same piece of ground, without change of seed, the samples which were originally clean soon became infected, which increased every subsequent year, until at length the varieties which had been longest cultivated became so completely covered with mildew and smut, that out of the produce of three square yards or so, we could get scarcely a single head free from the fungi. In. this instance there is reason to suppose that the spores were propagated by inoculation on the seed, and also that they were imbibed through the cellular tissue of the rootlets, along with the water containing the nutritive matters afforded by the soil."
"Mary more interesting cases might be brought forward to show the extensive operations which these minute plants perform in the vegetable economy, which I cannot follow further at present. In the foregoing observations I have endeavoured to treat the subject in rather a popular manner, avoiding such scientific details us would necessarily be tedious, if not uninteresting, to those who have not hitherto turned their attention to such investigations. I believe the only cure yet known for smut and mildew, is steeping the seed, if grain, in chemical solutions calculated to destroy the vegetative principle of the spores of the fungi, with a proper rotation of cropping. My object in noticing the matter in the foregoing part of this paper has been with a view of directing the attention of practical gentlemen to its importance. The fungi which has so uniformly accompanied the potato disease, prove that they have sone connection with it, as I do not think a single tuber on which the decay had progressed to any considerable extent, but what became more or less less covered with the Psilonia rosae of Berkley. At a late meeting of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland a paper was read on this subject by Mr. Goodsir, when a practical gentleman who was present stated that he had been for a number of years in the habit of steeping a bole of wheat in three quarters of a pound of sulphate of copper (or bluestone) dissolved in water, which he had found to be an effectual remedy against the corn fungi. I would beg to suggest to such as are fond of trying experiments, to steep some of the seed potatoes in such solutions as our chemical friends may recommend, being persuaded the root is the right end to begin at in endeavouring to find a remedy for the evil. I am aware that several persons have already tried this, and I am doing so myself, having steeped some in a solution of salt in water, and am making preparation to try the sulphate of copper steep. :"
"CO  The great importance of raising new seedling varieties of the potato ought to be specially attended to, not that I think seedlings recently raised were less subject to be affected by the disease, but because I feel convinced there yet remains great room for improving this important esculent in form, produce, and quality, though it might be supposed, that by general consent, it were agreed that potato culture had reached the acme of perfection, so far as attempts have been made to improve varieties of late years; and in this point of view, the late failure may yet be found to have been the cause of producing important results."
"To make the most of sound seed, is another consideration which forces itself on our attention at the present time. I believe it has generally occurred that tubers which were much divided at planting were more liable to decay than those which were planted whole. It might, therefore, be a somewhat hazardous experiment to cut potatoes much, while such uncertainty prevails concerning their growth; but from experience I can vouch that young shoots taken from tubers, after they have grown three or four inches, and have their rootlets, will grow and produce excellent crops, if carefully removed from the tuber, and planted separately, and in this way sound seed might be amazingly increased, as we annually prove in the Botanic Garden. I do not however, mean the long blanched shoots which grow from potatoes crowded in close pits; to be successful the tubers must be placed in situations where the young shoots will get both light and air, and thereby gain some strength before they are removed from the older tuber. It is also necessary to choose moist, cloudy weather for planting if possible."
"An experiment of this nature is now being tried in the Garden, at the suggestion of his excellency the Lord Lieutenant. I have been directed by the council of the Royal Dublin Society to remove the young shoots, produced from diseased tubers, and plant them separately, to prove what effect that will have in staying the decay, the results of which I shall have the honour of reporting to the Society at a future period."
POTATO PLANTING AND TURNIP SEED
"Farmers Gazette, April 18"", 1846, page 826"
"SIB—I have just read your advice on potato planting, with much interest. My chief reason for advising the use of very dilute sulphuric acid and lime wass drawn from the character of the Botrytis fungus, This was the fungus which was detected in the earlier stages of the disease. This is developed and thrives in: a faintly ammoniacal medium, where decaying azotized matter is present.. A trace of sulphuric acid prevents its development-, perhaps by destroying the ammoniacal compound which feeds it; and a slight powdering of lime, besides taking up excess of acid, may prevent fungi, which are developed in acid media."
"In careful hands, my recommendation of 22nd ultimo may do much good. My only reason for not forbidding cut sets was the fear of want of seed. Slice then, a gentleman has stated that he planted the same variety on two lots of the same soil, in March last; the one lot had cut sets, the other uncut. On inspection"
"278  last week, the uncut sets gave a promising appearance, and seemed quite sound; the cut sets, though sound when planted, now showed ail the signs of disease. He seems not to have steeped his sets; yet this fact should be a warning against planting any but whole tubers; and it seems to show that either the soil is infections, or predisposes the potato to disease. It was this supposition which made me advise lime to the soil in yours of 22nd. As we know that poison enters the blood more readily by inoculation than where the skin is entire, so, cutting the potato may expose it to what it cannot bear this"
season.
"I have lately read in the Universal Prussian Gazette, that ""the very soil is corrupted by the disease.” In Prussia, they must have some reason for this affirmation, and our safest course is, to take the precaution dictated by this"
supposition.
"As to the time of planting, I prefer the period between the 25th April and 15th May. Much depends on the plants growing soon; and at present they might come away favourably. But we know that electricty hastens organic decay; we have reason to suppose that the electricity of last autumn aided in developing the disease; and we know that the atmosphere is at present in an unusually electrified state. Last night we had here a tropica! discharge of lightning, with almost deafening thunder, and as the sets are not very vigorous, I would fear their injury from lightning, if planted before the heat and moisture favour"
growth.
"|, last year, advised the trial of planting shoots; but the facts stated by Dr. Trench in next Gazette tended to show that the plants are weaker, later, and more disposed to disease, when deprived of early nourishment from the tuber; and as we may fear our sets are not very vigorous this spring, planting shoots, beyond a small breadth, for trial, may be unsafe. :"
"TURNIP SEED My seedsman had often told me that old seed, if kept dry, grows fully as well as new, and offered to take back any left by me. Some years ago, I had left 4 Ibs. white globe seed which stood over the year in a dry room in a paper bag unopened. I sowed it next year. Not a plant came up, unless about a dozen on a spot damper than the rest, and where couch had been burnt. The soil, and treatment of the whole field were very uniform, and all the new seed grew freely. A neighbour lost nearly all his crop by sowing old seed. The vitality of seeds is weakened by long keeping in a mass, where air is admitted and hence they grow only in the most favourable conditions— ;"
"Yours, &e., P. Garden, Glenae, Dumfries, 13"" April, 1846."
"P.S.—By turning to your GAZETTE of 29th November last, you will see that all my inorganic manures manifestly diminished the potato crop, and Epsom salt more than any other. In lot 6th, the Epsom salt was decomposed by chalk, and part of the evil was thus prevented; but in lot 12th, where lime was not present (cither in chalk or bone-dust), the salts were highly pernicious. I intend, this season, to plant either without dung, or by covering a small portion of dung, as you recommend; and. when the plants are above ground, to sow guano in the"
"O  furrows between the drills, and mix it in the soil by the potato grubber (or scuffle), when II see the prospect of a shower. Thus, I hope, the manure will be put sufficiently near the plants to aid growth, and yet not injure vitality.—P. G."
IS THE POTATO DISEASE CONTAGIOUS?
"Farmers Gazette, April 18°"", 1846, page 826"
"Sir—l am in the habit, when digging out early potatoes, of having such tubers as appear fit for seed laid by on the drill or ridge, and whon they have been exposed to the action of the air long enough to render them green in the heart, I store them on a dry loft, spreading them out singly, in the same manner as gardners store apples for winter and spring use. The accompanying samples formed a portion of some of the variety known in Connaught by the name of Cork Reds, which were so treated and stored in the month of August last; but as the crop had been slightly affected with the prevailing disease, I had them examined in the month of November, and finding that notwithstanding all the care with which they had been selected, nearly one-half of them were beginning to decay. I had all those which showed the smallest symptoms of the disease removed, and gave directions that they should be thrown on the dung heap. My gardener, however, is, in his way, an experimentalist, and he opened a trench about a foot deep, under the southern aspect of my garden wall, and threw them in, one over the other, somewhat as if he was pitting them, covering them with dry turf mould. About a fortnight ago he told me they were growing, and on examining them, I found this was really the case, and as anything tending to throw light upon the character of the disease of last year, especially as regards its possible effect upon our prospect of a crop this season, is likely to interest your readers, I selected the specimens sent herewith for your information :—They were growing on in a mass of prutresccnt tubers, and I leave you to comment on the appearance they present. You will observe that one of them is a sound tuber, a few of which were, by mistake, removed with those which were palpably decaying. The sample of purple eyed Americans was part of an autumn sown crop which grew in my garden last season. When they were removed some early cabbages were planted in their room, and on landing the latter, last week, the specimen I send was dug up, having been accidently left in the ground where the potato crop was being dug. I leave you to comment on its appearance, the crop of which it formed part was largely affected with the prevalent disease, and it, of course, remained all the winter in the supposed infected ground—"
"Yours,&c.,WM. LE POER TRENCH. Lissavalley, Dangan, Co. Galway, 16th April, 1846."
"[The specimens of diseased potatoes which accompanied Dr. Trench's communication, were all in an active state of vegetation, and, with the exception of one, all the shoots (which were about six inches long) appeared to be quite healthy and free from fungi. The old tubers were a perfect mass of"
"280  putrefaction; and the one from which the diseased shoot was growing, had a small potato attached to it. It is not improbable that in some cases, and under very favourable circumstances, diseased seed may produce a healthy crop; but as these must form the exception to the general rule, the wiser course is, to use sound potatoes only as seed."

"-SIR—I dare say that by this time of day you believe that we Irishmen are capable of entertaining feelings of gratitude for every act of kindness conferred on us, or even expressed towards us; but it sometimes happens, whether through modesty, diffidence, or bashfulness or perhaps all three combined, our feelings in thin respect may escape being given expression to, and sometimes, when we screw up our courage to express our gratitude to a public benefactor, we do it as Irish like that the said benefactor, who would ""do good by stealth and blush to find it praise,"" would probably ""rather not"" hear it. If now, in expressing my gratitude, and that, of many a ""Paddy"" beside my self, towards your “esteemed correspondent, Mr. Garden, of Glenae',” for his advice in regard to dipping the lumpers in "" water slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid,"" to insure not only vegetation, but safety against "" plague."" I should appear rather uncouth, I hope Mr. Garden will attribute it, to an absence of refinement more than through a wish to offend; but the. belter In guard against prolixity, I shall merely say, Mr. Garden has our gratitude to as great, an extent, as the potato commissioners had when they advised the “sprinkling of bog water."""
"Mr. Garden is, if possible, entitled to our gratitude in another degree; and as I happened to take the liberty so far with him, I hope he will bear with me a little farther, the more especially if I should quote, a passage or two of his letter, and endeavour to show him that they were not merely supererogatory, but calculated to lessen that degree of gratitude some of us thought we owed him. He says—"" I wrote it (the letter) under an impression that every precaution ought to be used to secure a good sound potato crop."" This we believe, and for which intention on his part, as I have already said, we thank him. He further says—""lIf we are to credit James Macklin's letter, my precautions are utterly useless. Knowing neither the man nor his locality, I leave his statements to those better able to estimate their truth and value than, at this distance, I can. Had Mr. Garden not endeavoured to excite a sneer against Mr. Macklin, his former letters would have, in all probability, passed for more than they were worth: but ""neither knowing the man nor his locality,"" he may have taken Mr. Macklin for some nondescript unworthy of notice beyond his ""locality."""
"After this insinuation, I think, sir, it is but fair that the public, who may feel an interest in Mr. Macklin's excellent letter, should be told who the writer is. Mr. Macklin is a respectable steward and gardener, an Irishman, possessing talents of the first order, of great professional experience, acquired in England as well as in Ireland; a man of powerful mind, of studious habits, and who paid more attention to the practical and scientific culture of potatoes, the cause and prevention of their"
"ie)  diseases, for the last fifteen years, than most men, and so far, to say the very least for him, entitled to as much credit for what he states as Mr. Garden, whoever he may be. But Mr. Garden says of Mr. Macklin's statements, "" they are contrary to my experience, and to that of others on whose testimony I can rely."" Now I say, in juxtaposition, "" they are not contrary to my experience, nor to those of others on whose testimony I can rely."""
"I should be disposed to stop hero with Mr. Garden, were it not for an insinuation he has thrown out of a nature less charitable than the sneer he would indulge in—an insinuation attempting to disparage the character of an agriculturist fully as respectable in that capacity as he is at least, whatever his station may be. The in- sinuation is this : in speaking of the disease in Canada— "" If it shall turn out that J. M. has involved thousands of his fellowmen in famine and ruin by the heedless practice which his letter encouraged, he has, dared a fearful responsibility."" It may be some consolation to Mr. Garden, whose solicitude for Old Ireland appears so great to be told, he has nothing dangerous in our regard to apprehend from the letter of Mr. Macklin. Mr. Garden further says—"" It is quite possible that my letter may have been likely to mar the prospects of some who hoped to pocket a high price for seed potatoes grown in low warm soils. It is the interest of such "" gentlemen"" to laugh at my cautions and be witty over my words” It is but justice to Mr. Garden to say, his “words"" are not so very mischievous as he would suppose in exciting the "" broad grin"" or "" sharp wit"" of the "" gentlemen"" he alludes to; nor is Mr. Macklin so much as one of the class even."
"One word more and I have done. Mr. Garden says— ""I am not to be drawn into a disputation with J. M. on the subject."" This sentence, I suspect, has more real arid substantial wisdom in it than all the rest he has written; and to show I wish to ""practice as I preach,"" I shall adopt the quotation, by reversing the initials, "" / am not to be drawn into a disputation with P. G. on the subject—"

"THE POTATO DISEASE Farmers Gazette, April 25th 1846, pages 837-838"
"The prospects of the farmers with regard to the potato crop of 1846, are brightening, unreasonable fears are giving way to more confident expectations, and the feverish excitement which the public mind has laboured under for the last few months, is subsiding into a more calm and rational condition. Professor Johnston and the other gentlemen, appointed along with him to investigate ""the Potato Disease in Scotland,"" have published their second pamphlet on this subject, from which it appears that no very serious scarcity of seed exists in that country, and that reasonable hopes are entertained of a remunerative crop being obtained this year. The Scotch are proverbial for their caution; and seldom has the national characteristic been so strongly exemplified, as in the investigation of the potato disease. While several writers in"
"282  the south were thundering forth denunciations against the potato crop of 1846, and horrifying every man, woman, and child in the United Kingdom, with the prospect of losing the potato and being reduced to the necessity of living on Jerusalem artichokes, and other unpalatable roots, with hard names, and harder hearts, the ""canny"" Scotch have been silently, yet persevering, accumulating facts by experiments and information collected from all quarters."
"The results of these experiments, and the deductions there from, are contained * in the pamphlet already alluded to, and we give the sections in which these are embodied almost entire, as they contain much information that may be immediately useful to our readers."
CHANCES OF A HEALTHY CROP IN 1846.
"This chance of a reasonable return is considerably increased by the healthy appearance of the sprouted potatoes in this country. They lend no countenance, as we have said, to the opinion that the new potato crop is certain to prove diseased. We are unwilling, indeed, under any circumstances, to give way to despondency; and even should it continue, we cannot think that the disease will be beyond a remedy. We would not advise any of our farmers to abandon hastily or in despair the culture of any useful crop, much less that of the productive, profitable, and useful potato. Rather study its nature more profoundly—its constitution, its wants, and the diseases to which it is liable. Science may be slow, but if we encourage it, and apply its deductions in our practice, we may be sure that it will at last give us the mastery over everything but the fickle elements. We are sure that the potato is not about to leave us, and we expect that the national perseverance will rescue it from its present difficulties."
"We recommended in our last letter the careful selection of sound seed when such was to be obtained; though, as we stated, we did not consider it"
impossible to raise a healthy crop from tainted tubers. The following -
experiments remove nearly all the doubts we had upon the subject.
"4. We selected four weeks ago some buff potatoes apparently sound, which had sprouted luxuriantly in a pit alongside of many diseased and rotten ones. These we have since kept with their green leaves, and they still show no symptoms of disease. From these facts we conclude that potatoes apparently sound, though taken from a diseased heap, may produce apparently healthy plants."
"2. In October 1845 we took several varieties of diseased potatoes, carefully removed the affected portions, dipped the sound portions in water containing two per cent, of sulphuric acid for a couple of minutes, and then sprinkled them with powdered quicklime, and spread them on the floor of a potato house covered with straw. When examined in February, they were found quite sound and healthy, the eyes looking full and fresh We planted a portion of each sort on the 3rd of March last in boxes, and set the them in hot-house. When examined on the 31st, they were found as follows:—"
"No. |. Cups, six cuts ; all growing vigorously. No signs of decay. They had"
"made roots. No. 2. Rough Reds, four cuts; growing well and strong. No. 3. Berwickshire blues, four cuts. Of these three were sound and growing well; one"
O  cut blind but fresh.
"Some American earlies, which had been kept under straw, and which, from being near a stove, had made shoots 3 or 4 inches long, were planted whole on the 7th February upon a border at the foot of a south wall without any preparation. They grew well till cut down by the frost on the 19th of March; but they are now recovering, and putting up new shoots which look strong and healthy."
"The same is the case with some which were planted in different parts of the outside garden, both whole and cut, the cut sets being previously dipped in the acid so- lution. No dung was put in with them, the land being sufficiently rich from manure dug in at the end of last year. Of these American earlies many were partially diseased, "" Upon the efficacy of gypsum in preserving diseased sets, in comparison with sulphuric acid, we made the following experiments :—"
"Partially diseased potatoes were taken, the diseased parts removed, the sets dusted with gypsum, planted in boxes on the 3rd of March, and placed in the hothouse,"
"""No. 1. Cups, six sets. Of these five are growing, and one rotten."
"""No. 2. Rough reds, four cuts. Of which one is growing sound and healthy, one weak and small, but fresh, and two completely rotten."
"""No. 3. Berwickshire blues, four cuts. All growing, but one cut partly rotten."
"These experiments show that although gypsum, to a certain extent preserves the cut potato or checks its decay, it is not equal in this respect to sulphuric acid. The dipping process, as described in our previous letter, is so simple that it can be easily performed by any one, and we again recommend it for trial. The water may be mixed with one and a half or two pounds of acid to ten gallons of water, but the quantity should never for any kind of potato exceed three pounds to ten gallons. One of us has tried it at Barochan on a small scale for three years past with the best results."
"""From the above experiments we conclude that the sound parts of diseased potatoes may yield apparently sound plants."
"""e. Half an acre of potatoes planted by one of us at Barochan at the end of February, with sets cut from unsound tubers and dipped in the acid solution, are begining to come away quite strong and healthy, and have thrown out roots. They are planted in lazy-beds, with a little earth between them and the dung—a pre- caution which ought not to be neglected."
"Further Mr. Hugh Hunter of Poteath farm. West Kilbride, Ayrshire, writes us as follows :—' I planted about half an acre of potatoes in the middle of last May with common farm-yard dung. The seed was very much diseased, as I had a little of the disease the previous year. The potatoes did not keep well in the pits, and looked very bad at the time of planting. I had almost no hope of their growing at all. The crop grown was the freest of the disease I have seen this season—scarcely a bad one—and has kept best over winter."""
"""Therefore a healthy crop may be raised from diseased seed."""
"284  ""Experiments recently made in Sussex, and reported to the Royal Agricultural Society, as well as others made in Belgium, have led to similar satisfactory results. We are sanguine enough to believe, therefore, that, so far as the seed is concerned, there is good hope for the potato grower still."""
IMPORTANCE OF RAISING SEED POTATOES
"We arc most anxious to draw the attention of practical men to the importance of raising a portion of their potato crop especially for seed. At present many are paying large prices for seed brought from a distance, without actually knowing that the stock from which it has been taken is in reality sounder than that of many of their neighbours, especially in the higher parts of their several counties. But with a little more art, we believe, that every district at least, if not every farm, may safely grow seed potatoes for itself; and we again urge the propriety of every potato growing farmer setting aside a small portion of his land for this purpose."
"in growing potatoes for seed, the following precautions ought to be adopted:—"
"""a. Apiece of dry, open, rather poor soil ought to be selected."
"""c. If any fermented manure is applied, it should be ploughed in the autumn, or as long before the potato planting as is convenient."
"""'c. Sound seed should be selected, and of those varieties which, like the forty folds, the American earlies, and the white-flowered cups, have been least affected by disease during the present year."
""" d. The cuts or sets should be dipped in water soured with one or two per cent, of sulphuric acid, and dried with quick lime as above described; or should he sprinkled at once with gypsum. ;"
"""@. In the drills they should be placed without manure, or mixed saline manures only should be applied. These saline manures may also be applied as a top- dressing to the young crop before the earthing up. ;"
"""g. Lastly, the potatoes should be planted shallow, not deeply earthed up, and, as most people think, taken up before they are fully ripe."
SPECIAL SALINE MANURE FOR THE POTATO CROP
"In our last letter .we urged the expediency of using saline instead of fermenting manures for the potato crop of the present year, as least likely to be followed by disease. When fermenting manure is used, it will be safest to plough it into the land before making the drills; or if it must be put into the drill, to spread a layer of earth between it and the seed."
"When half dung is ploughed in, the other half may be replaced by soot, by guano, by a mixture of four bushels of bones dissolved in sulphuric acid, with one cwt. of Peruvian or Ichaboe guano, and one cwt. of sulphate of magnesia, or of the same quantity of bones, with half a cwt. each of nitrate, sulphate, and carbonate of soda, sulphate of potash, and of sulphate of magnesia. These mixtures may either be put into the drills when the potatoes are planted, or may be applied as a top-dressing before the potatoes are earthed up."
A special manure for the potato should contain all those things present in the healthy tuber which it derives from the soil alone and nearly in the same proportion.
"©  One of us has caused numerous experiments of the ash of the potato to be made in the laboratory of the Agricultural Chemistry Association, and from the results of these analyses we are induced to recommend the following mixture, as likely to prove a valuable specific manure for the growth of the potato :—"
Sulphate of Soda 10 Ibs Coimnon salt 10 Ibs Nitrate of soda 10 Ibs Carbonate of soda 20 Ibs Sulphate of potash 10 Ibs Sulphate of magnesia 10 Ibs Hone-dust 32 Ibs Sulphate of ammonia 10 Ibs 112 Ibs.
"Or for the sulphate of ammonia, 10 Ibs. of Peruvian guano may be substituted—the several ingredients being intimately mixed or ground together."
"The ash of the potato contains a very large proportion of soda. Hence the large quantity of soda salts in the above mixture, which can be made up at a cost of from £5 to £7 a ton."
"Applied with half dung previously ploughed in three cwt. of this mixture should be put into the drills, or laid on as a top-dressing in moist weather, if possible, and before the earthing up. Without other manure, it may be applied at the rate of six cwt. per acre. If laid in the drills, a top-dressing of lime may be applied before the earthing up."
"We shall be glad to hear of the results of this application to the potato crop generally, but especially to that which is intended for seed. We recommend it, however, only for the potato crop.—We have the honour to be, gentlemen, your obedient servants,"
"JAMES F. W. JOHNSTON, WM. M. FLEMING AND R. K. GREVILLE."
POTATO CULTURE

"SIR — In reading your excellent note on ""Soda Ash,"" it struck me that if the guano were used, as you advise, the soda ash might, with advantage, be deferred for about six weeks after the guano, and then given by hand, as a top-dressing between the drills. If previously mixed with a little powder of chalk, or of dry bog- mould, this soda dressing would be given with better effect. No lumps of it should touch the stems. If the scuffler can be used to mix it, the better; but if this would"
"286  endanger the stems, it may be dispensed with, as the soda not being volatile, will be carried into the soil by next rain, and when given at this advanced period of the season, will carry on growth, and help to protect the tubers from worms. From experiments some years ago, ! I would strongly disaagree giving the soda in the drills before the sets. In the first stage of potato growth, the plants are fed entirely by the sets. If we can keep up their supply of food afterwards, our duty is performed. Never give hand manures under a clear sun or dry air, but in prospect of a shower —"

"STEEPING POTATO SEED IN DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID Farmers Gazette, May 2""%, 1846, pages 9-10"
"siR — In the Pamphlet, No. 7, on the Potato Disease in Scotland, which ! lately sent you, there is a very valuable suggestion in relation to the steeping the sets ‘intended for planting, in very dilute sulphuric acid, and afterwards dusting them with quick lime."
"As persons are sometimes apt to imagine that there is some mystery in the use of substances with which they are but little acquainted, and feeling the importance of any suggestion which might in the least tend to prevent a recurrence of the national calamity that has befallen us, I have thought it desirable to describe the mode in which the suggestion alluded to might be put in practice, premising, as you are already aware, that the substance formed by the combination of sulphuric acid with quick lime, is sulphate of lime or gypsum. As this substance is well known to most of your readers, they may be, perhaps, induced to make a trial, when otherwise they might be afraid of the consequences resulting from its application."
"The sulphuric acid is put into a tub, diluted with fifty times its weight of water, the potato sets are put into a basket, the basket then dipped into the tub, over the mouth, of which sticks are placed, the basket is then placed on the sticks so that the liquid may drain back into the tub, the seed is then thrown out of the basket, and the lime, thrown with a shovel, dusted over it. This is the whole process at once, cheap, simple, and expeditious."
"It is recommended also to be cautious in the use of much or highly fermented manure: and in any .case I should strongly recommend the placing some earth on the manure, and on this earth depositing the seed, in this way preventing its coming in actual contact with the manure. This can be accomplished in various ways, according to the different methods of planting pursued; and I am sure no one will think a little extra trouble or expense thrown away in making experiments on a matter so deeply affecting the very existence of so many of our poor population."
"O  Though it must be confessed we as yet know nothing of the cause of the disease, it by no means follows as a necessary consequence, that we may not discover a cure: in fact this has been done with respect to diseases of the wheat and other plants; and however desirable it doubtless is that we should arrive at a knowledge of the causes producing disease, we must remember that what might seem to be the natural order of events is frequently reversed, and that we have, in some cases, arrived at a knowledge of the nature of disease from reasoning on the fact that certain applications have effected a cure, and being thus led to consider what the properties were which could have produced this result, and in what manner-"

"sSIR—I observe you strongly recommend planting whole potatoes this year. I found on cutting early seed, several infected with the disease, that I thought quite sound before being cut, so that I think there is a risk in sowing whole seed. I had the potatoes that showed the least faint, on being cut, put aside for cattle, &c., and planted the sound-looking sets: they are now coming up well. The kind—the Early Pink-eye; I put down a few of the infected sets, and on looking at them this day found some rotten, and others putting out very weak shoots..—"

"SAVING POTATOES Farmers Gazette, May 9"", 1846, page 25"
"siR—Any thing like success in saving the last, or in growing the present potato crop, must be interesting to your readers."
"I have ten Irish acres planted with cups, six of which are coming through the ground very strong, and without the least appearance of any failure. They were cut and planted in the usual way in drills; but I would strongly recommend your excellent advice, to put earth between the dung and the seed."
"Some of your gifted correspondents have smiled at my simple method of saving the potato; but, nevertheless, it has been successful, and highly beneficial to my employer. From seven Irish acres I have handed him £243. 3s. 6d., besides supplying his establishment and my own house, ploughmen, &c., since July, with excellent potatoes—a sample of which I have sent you to judge of their quality. This result has not been accomplished without paying the greatest attention, to the state of the atmosphere and the size of the heaps, regarding which I may find"
"288  leisure again to communicate. In the meantime,"
"I am, sir, JAMES WADDEM,,. Steward to Sir K. Shaw, Bart., Bushy Park, 6th May, 1846."
"We hope Mr. Waddem will not forget to give us, in detail, the plan he has so successfully pursued in saving potatoes. Such information may be of no inconsiderable importance with regard to the next crop."
"ON THE POTATO DISEASE Farmers Gazette, May 9'"", 1846, page 25"
"siIR—There have been but few subjects which has been so extensively or so well discussed as the epidemic which affected the potato crop last year all over Europe, more especially in this country. The subsequent remedial measures for preserving the potato, and the observations with respect to their future cultivation, have all been ably handled through the pages of your valuable GAZETTE."
"It appears to me, however, that not a few have taken rather a desponding view of the potato disease, and have expressed their fears that this most useful esculent is likely to wear itself out in this country, and have, consequently, recommended a variety of measures to prevent such a calamity. If such people were to reflect for a little, I do not think that they would see sufficient cause for such a misfortune befalling us."
"Your readers are aware that epidemics have prevailed for time immemorial all over the globe—more especially since the year 1817, when the blue (or spasmodic) cho- lera first broke out in India. Since we were visited in Europe by that dreadful scourge, a most severe epidemic has destroyed an immense number of cattle, sheep, and swine, &c.; yet, when cholera was depopulating the country to an alarming extent, no one, I believe, even dreamed that the human race was about to become extinct: or, since then, that of the lower class of animals, &c."
"Those who have observed the progress of cholera in this country, must remember what precautions were had recourse to, to mitigate its attack, and to prevent its spreading; and the result of the precautionary measures then adopted have ever since been obviously most beneficially shown, on the improved health of the community very generally, where the disease visited, but more particularly in Ireland."
"There are not many who can forget how dreadfully this country had periodically suffered from typhus fever; and still fewer, the great mortality that followed in its train; but since the cholera disappeared from among us, the fever has been of rather rare occurrence, and of far less severity than formerly. This incalculable blessing is owing, I have no doubt, to the more cleanly habits, and freer ventilation, &c., established then amongst all classes. This was not, however, effected, in many instances, in the dwellings of the lower order, without much difficulty, so wedded"
"(@)  were the people to their long-cherished habits; and this you must daily meet with, in their strong prejudice against any improvement in the cultivation of their farms, &c., and which you and others are so strenuously exerting yourselves to overcome."
"I am in the hope, in like manner, that the great attention which has been drawn to the potato disease, and its cultivation and after-management, so far from the epidemic being found a calamity it will be followed by extensive and lasting benefits, to the lower order in general, and the country in particular."
"Although the disease in the potato may subside let us exert ourselves to prevent or ameliorate the next epidemic, in whatever way it may unfortunately visit us, by cleanliness, free ventilation, draining, &c., in and round our dwellings, out-houses, and stack-yards, as also by draining, manuring, and properly pulverizing the land, so as to allow the confined air and moisture to escape freely, before they become charged with deleterious impregnations, to insure health and abundant crops, as far as we can; for it is but reasonable to suppose, that the other descriptions of crops—fruit, vegetables, &c.—are just as liable to an epidemic visitation as man, or other animals, potatoes, &c.; nor need any one be surprised, who has travelled much"
"_ over this country and noticed the slovenly manner which farming has been but too often conducted, at such things occurring; for it is frequently difficult to distinguish whether weeds or grain is the crop the farmer had tilled for. Should we, under such a state of cultivation, either wonder at, or lament the visitation we have just suffered I believing as I do that such a castigation was loudly called for, and that it will ultimately be favoured by the same results which followed the cholera, and from the same reasons,"
"lam, &c, M. STEILL, Dublin, May 6, 1846."
REMARKS ON THE POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, May 9'"", 1846, pages 58-59"
"sIR—As a constant reader of your paper, I beg to say, that since the commencement of the period with which we were visited by this disheartening calamity, the cause of so much excitement and alarm, I have, with no little attention, observed the many communications of remarks and reports published through the pages of your valuable and widely circulated GAZETTE; and, notwithstanding the various conclusions pretended to have been arrived at (as to the proper way of securing, preserving, and finally renovating the crop, by attending to certain adopted rules) by men of both practical and scientific knowledge, it is to be learned that this mysterious matter as yet remains unexplained."
"However, it is consolatory to hear no complaints of the forthcoming crops being in any degree affected, or if so, but slightly. My reason for speaking thus is, that about the latter end of January I carefully selected about 4 stones of Fox's seedling potatoes,—middle size, and to all appearance perfectly sound, not having above two per cent, diseased, and but slightly, in last year's crop, these I excited in a pine"
"290  stove, temperature ranging about 60 deg., until I transplanted them, about the first of March, into a bed of stable litter, previously prepared for them, at the regular distances in such cases, taking every care not to allow the potato to come in any contact whatever with the soil of which the bed was composed, and where, by having attention paid them, I was able to get them clear of the frost, which was but trifling. But what was my astonishment, since beginning to use them, to find the young tubers showing symptoms of disease; and up to this day |! find, with certainty, they are getting much worse."
"I also, on a light loamy fresh lea, in the beginning of February, planted about an acre, in ridges of about three feet wide, which width I considered best adapted or the success of the crop at that season. The sorts planted were one rood of cup potatoes, one rood Bangors, one rood pink-eyes, and the remainder. different sorts, which I raised from seed in 1844. In planting, the mode adopted was laying the sets on the surface, and covering with thoroughly fermented stable soil, but which was used very sparingly."
"The crop, at present, is about four or five inches over the surface, but having about 10 per cent, failure in the Bangors, about six in the pink-eyes, but none, that I could discover, in either seedling or cups."
"This is not the failure that led me to make those remarks, but one of a more serious nature, and visible in the stems, which I discovered during the last week. On going through them I observed that a number of the young plants appeared to be much shrivelled, and stunted in their growth, their leaves being very much curled; upon examination I found the part under the clay all over with a cancerous substance, something like iron rust, and which, as far as I could think, is about 23 per cent, in the Bangors, and but slightly in the other sorts; while the sets beneath these diseased steins are perfectly sound."
"However, this is not the case with the forced ones as described above, their stems being perfectly sound, while the disease is solely in the young tubers, and, in another instance, I forced three tubers almost wholly covered with cancer, in pots, and at an earlier stage of their growth than those I put in the bed above described—inured them to out temperature—they appear-to be in a most healthy state, but have produced no tubers as yet"
"Now. leaving out these few instances as mere matters of casualty, and taking into consideration the silence of your widely extended and intelligent correspondents on this head, I am persuaded to infer these effects on the out-growing young plants were produced by letting the dung come in contact with them, a circumstance which I have since avoided, and I believe with good effect."
"Submitting these matters to your discretion, you are at liberty to give them publicity, and hoping to be a single exception in the successful culture of an edible of so much value to the poor man.—"
"Yours, &c., E. MOLLOY, Stradbally Hall, 20th May, 1846."
"O  THE POTATO CROP, AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENTS, ETC. Farmers Gazette, May 9"", 1846, page 59"
"Sir—May I request that you will allow me to trespass a little on your valuable time, and widely circulated columns, while I point out the evident distress prevailing in this part of the country where I at present reside, regarding seed, for the present crop, both potatoes and oats, in which the classes are very much deficient, and in all probability would have been unable to put in a crop this season, had it not been for the liberality of the soil proprietor, C.K. O'Hara, Esq., and his goodhearted agent, R, Beere, Esq., who have been distributed a full supply to their tenantry of the following seeds, namely— Potatoes, clover, grass-seed, turnips, rape, cabbages: vetches, &c., &c., and a sufficient supply of that valuable manure, guano, to apply to the crops."
"I feel disposed fo assert, that in all cases where guano bad been used as a manure, the potato crop, which apparently suffered from that prevalent contagion, show only, in a few instances, to have suffered, and am happy to state, the potato crop which has been planted, is showing, by the healthy shoots, and expansion of the leaves, that the produce will be luxuriant next season. This has been the case, with a few exceptions, in which I attribute failure to planting in immediate contact with dung. The potatoes were planted in lazy-beds on the consequently the ammoniacal substances emitting from the decomposing manures coming in immediate contact with the cut seeds injured their vitality."
"May I add a little more regarding of the kindness of the landlord, before mentioned, who by all possible means promotes agricultural pursuits throughout his extensive estate, carried out by the agent, who devises works of improvemenis in drainage, fencing, road making, building &c. and the expenses attending which are liberally defrayed by the proprioter."
"Yours, &c., C. Murphy, Coolaney, May 13, 1846."
"POTATOES Editorial - Farmers Gazette, May 30°"", 1846, pages 73-74"
"Ever since the potato disease of last year occurred, many attempts have been made by public writers and lecturers to discover an adequate cause for it, but, as yet, no satisfactory conclusion has been arrived at respecting its nature. Much valuable information has, however, been elicited as to the most likely means by which a future recurrence of failure may be modified; and taking these into connection with the fact, that human ingenuity has devised various plans for making even the most diseased potatoes available as wholesome food for man, we are led to the consolatory conclusion that if a calamity similar to what befell the potato crop last year should again occur, the experience of the past will enable us to save the produce from that utter destruction which much of the last year's crop fell a prey to. Cobbett, whose antipathy to the potato amounted to a species of"
"292  monomania, used to say, that any nation or country that would submit to live on such a root as the potato, deserved to be wretched. Although Ireland presents a somewhat remarkable coincidence of human suffering, and an excessive use of the potato as an article of diet, yet, to condemn the cultivation of it altogether on such grounds would be absurd. It is the abuse, and not the use of the potato as an article of food, that deserves reprobation. That the Irish peasant has carried the vise of potatoes to an extent extremely detrimental to the development of his muscular powers, cannot be denied; but as he has been accustomed all his life to ‘the potato as the main article of his daily subsistence, it would not merely be unwise, but most injurious to his health, were he to abandon suddenly that description of food upon which his body has been reared."
"The great objection to the potato as a sole article of diet, is the immense bulk and weight that must he devoured in order to afford sufficient nourishment to sus- tain the body and supply the waste of the muscular system, which, in a labouring man, is very great. Potatoes contain but a small proportion of gluten (the substance from which muscle is formed), only about 2 per cent, in the very ‘best qualities, so that a man must eat 100 Ibs. of potatoes in order to obtain as much gluten as could be supplied by 10 or 12 Ibs. of wheaten flour; in the former the nutritive matter is spread over, and diffused through too great bulk, and in the latter it is too concentrated; hence neither potatoes nor wheaten flour, when used separately and alone, form a proper kind of food for man. Habit, however, in such cases, becomes second nature; thus an Irish labourer, who has been accustomed to make potatoes his principal, if not his only diet, for the greater part of the year, can eat with impunity ten, twelve, and even fourteen pounds of potatoes in a day; whereas, were an English labourer to attempt to put the same amount of material into his stomach, it would infallibly either kill him or produce disease; neither could the former subsist comfortably upon the concentrated wheaten diet of the latter, even although he actually obtained from it a greater quantity of really nutritive matter. The Irish peasant must have his stomach mechanically distended, in order to maintain it in a healthy condition; habit has rendered this necessary, and hence the repugnance he exhibits to the use of Indian corn; meal, and other condensed articles of food. The truth is, he can no more rid himself of this repugnance, than can his fellow labourer on the other side of the channel overcome his antipathy against living solely on potatoes. In changing, therefore, the diet of a people from one description of food to another, it is wrong to overlook the particular physical constitution which the long continued use of one kind of food has superinduced; and, consequently. when circumstances occur, as in the case of the potato failure, to render a change of diet necessary, it should be effected in such a manner as to do as little violence as possible to former predilections and habits."
"These remarks have been suggested by a very interesting meeting held at the South Dublin Union, for the purpose of examining the produce of the potato pre- pared there by order of the ""Relief Commissioners.” The chair was occupied by Sir Hubert Shaw Bart., and the company included most of the guardians of the two unions; and, also, several other gentlemen who had been invited to partake of a dejeuner, all the viands of which (with the exception of the coffee) were prepared from potatoes less or more diseased. Samples of potato flour, and meal, and of bread made of a mixture of these, with oatmeal and from beaten flour, were exhi-"
"O  bited on a side table. Amongst the specimens of bread were two kinds, especially worthy of remark, the one being made with equal parts of fine potato flour, and oatmeal, exactly similar in taste and appearance to common oaten bread, and the other which was composed of equal parts of fine potato flour, and fine wheaten flour, closely resembled wheaten bread, being only a little closer in texture and heavier looking, although not so to the taste. Amongst the great variety of eatables, made solely from the farina of potatoes, were jellies, blachmange, Spanish flummery, and different kinds of seed-cake. There were also other dishes of a more homely nature made from the potato meal, such as stirabout, soup, milk-porridge, &c., well adapted for the use of the labouring classes."
"Mr. Rogers, the gentleman under whose superintendance and instigation all these preparations from the potato were made, explained to those present at the meeting, after they had partaken of them, the different ingredients of which they were composed, and the various modes of making them. He stated that shortly after the potato disease had manifested itself, and become matter of notoriety, he had laid a plan before the Lord Lieutenant for converting diseased potatoes into wholesome food. This plan was referred to Professors Kane, Lindley, and Playfair, who, after experiment, gave it as their opinion that diseased potatoes could be so manufactured as to be perfectly wholesome, upon which he (Mr. Rogers) was immediately directed to proceed with his operations. Unfortunately, illness had prevented him from making much progress for some time; but he, nevertheless, hoped that the results of his labours would be in sufficient time to meet the exigencies of next year, concerning the potato crop, of which he felt apprehensive. Mr. Rodgers also submitted a plan to the meeting, showing that by introducing potato meal into the work-house, as a substitute for wheaten flour, a saving of £1,500 would be effected. He likewise entered into an exposition of the nutritive properties of the potato, proving that when the water is removed, and the solid matter dried and ground into meal, that it is nearly identical with wheaten flour, the latter only containing 25 per cent, more of gluten than the former. He showed also that a greater weight of nutritive matter could be obtained from an acre of potatoes than one of wheat."
"The Chairman expressed his astonishment at what he had seen, and at the statements made by Mr. Rogers regarding the nutritive properties of the potato compared with those of corn, which differed greatly from the opinions which he (the chairman) had formerly held on the subject. He would have supposed it impossible to put the potato in so many different forms as had been exhibited before them. He said further, that he had no apprehensions of a serious nature regarding next year's crop of potatoes. He had never seen a better prospect than his own potato fields presented at present—the stalks being six inches long, and perfectly healthy. He said that they all owed great obligations to Mr. Rogers for the handsome entertainment that had been provided for them, and also for the valuable informa- tion he had afforded, which would be of great use if disseminated through the country. In the name of the guardians, he would therefore return Mr. Rogers thanks."
"Mr. Rogers, in replying, stated that his great object was to render the manufacture"
"of the potato into food general throughout the whole country, so that every cottager might have it, under various forms, in addition to the usual mode of preparing it."
"294  It will be seen from the above details, that the objection stated in the former part of this article against the potato as an article of food, in consequence of ifs bulk, can be completely obviated by withdrawing the water from it, and converting the residue into meal; yet, in the case of the Irish labourer, we have already shown that habit has rendered bulk an essential condition in the character of his food, in order that his stomach may perform its functions healthily: hence, if, according to Mr. Rogers's plan, the labouring classes, or inmates of poor-houses, who have been accustomed to the use of the potato in its natural and bulky state, were suddenly to have their diet changed to a more condensed form, very serious consequences to their health might ensue. If, however, they can be induced to use partially one or other of the preparations which Mr. Rogers, by his ingenuity, has _ devised, then they may gradually be weaned from their blind attachment to the potato in its boiled state, and accustomed to food of a more concentrated and nu- tritious nature. It is evident, however, that the expense and trouble attending the making of potato meal must always operate against its general use, amongst the poorer Classes, for so long as they can get good, sound, mealy potatoes, they will never be induced to use them in any prepared form. In the case of diseased potatoes, Mr. Rodgers plan is most invaluable, and if the next potato crop should prove diseased, may be the means of saving the whole of it and rendering it available for human food."
"ON STORING POTATOES Farmers Gazette, May 30'"", 1846, page 74"
"siR—Notwithstanding the numerous accounts published from time to time regarding potatoes, the subject is still so important that I do not feel warranted in withholding - the following facts, and therefore place them at your disposal for publication or otherwise, as mat appear to you most judicious."
"In November last, potatoes quite free from the taint were put into small pits arranged for ventilation. On being examined twelve days after they were found quite dry and good. Being then closed up without ventilation they were examined after twelve days more, and found very wet, and decidedly tainted. All were then put into a house, spread out, and well dusted with slaked lime. Here they continued good for about two months when the rot set in with such virulence and cart loads were taken away so bad that I would not give them even to cattle, and it was thought not one would escape. As an experiment, I had about one and a half ton, which remained after a clean picking, put in layers with earth between each layer. The rot ceases at once and although near three months have elapsed, the potatoes are as sound as the day they were dug and of the one and a half ton half a stone have not decayed."
From this I think it may be inferred that the same potatoes require different
"treatment times and that having them in layers with earth between is the safest plan, upon the whole, that can be;"

"STOLEN CROP OF POTATOES . Farmers Gazette, June 13"", 1846, pages 106-107"
"SIR—As you requested, I shall describe the mode of culture so successfully adopted on this farm, in order to ensure a crop of cabbages in the season, in addition to the usual one of potatoes, without detriment to the latter."
"A field, of five statute acres, from which a crop of partially diseased potatoes had just been removed, was again drilled up, and as soon as the weather permitted cabbage plants were put in, eighteen inches asunder, the drills being twenty-seven inches to thirty inches wide. The planting commenced about the middle of November, and terminated the first week in December. In the meantime another field in oat-stubble, had been ploughed, cross-ploughed, prepared, and drilled, as before, and the plants dibbled by the middle of De- cember. About the middle of February a few early potatoes were put down, the cabbages being then weil established, and the planting of potatoes was continued at intervals until the11th of May. This latter operation was performed in the following manner—a man with a spade made openings between every two cabbage plants, pulverizing the earth under where the set was to be placed, a second shook a small quantity of powdered lime in these openings, and deposited the seed, and a third covered with the earth previously removed."
"This not only cleaned the land but loosened the ground and moulded the cabbage crop, and finished the cultivation until the latter was removed. I hope I have been sufficiently explicit, and that the foregoing explanation may enable you to place this most important subject before your readers in its proper light. —"

"296  POTATO SHOOTS PLANTING _ Farmers Gazette, June 13"", 1846, page 107"
"sIR__ As your pages are at all times open to any useful subject connected with agriculture, I take the libertyof offering a few hints on the management of potato sprouts."
"In May, 1835, when finishing my potato planting I found that I wanted about 2 cwt, of seed to finish a field of drills. I went into the potato house and found in one corner a parcel of small pinks, and in another place some small cups. I had them carefully separated, and laid into baskets; they were brought to the field late in the afternoon, when the great heat of the day was over. The manure was spread. The potatoes were carefully taken out of the baskets, and laid in the drill lengthwise, and covered by the men with shovels, with about 3 or 4 inches of the freshest and finest mould they could get. The buds were from 6 to 18 inches long. They made such rapid progress that the plough could never pass through them after the first cutting and landing, and a finer crop I never saw. They were a month or five weeks earlier than the rest of the field."
"By stretching them in the drill the rootlets, or feeders, at every joint begin to collect nourishment, and as they, generally, have twice or thrice as many feeders as pota- toes that are planted in the ordinary way, it is no wonder that they would be more prolific, by placing them lying fiat in the drill they have the manure to begin at, and by covering the whole shoot it will neither be suddenly affected by the influence of heat or cold, and as May or June is a good time for this kind of planting, the soil is generally in a state that will not be likely to injure them, as the temperature will, perhaps, be warmer than the house from whence they were taken."
"I hardly ever saw a potato house without a few neglected small potatoes in some corner of it; and if there be any such this year, it is all in good time in this month, but the sooner the better. Those who do not want them, might give them to their neighbours, as they are of very little value, for any other use, unless for planting. About ten days ago, I laid some small potatoes into a drill, with shoots from sixteen to twenty inches long; some of them had nine joints, with roots at each, ready to commence the business assigned to them by nature; they are now four or five inches over ground, and are better established than sets that were planted long before them. I often tried this plan, and never found it to fail. When 1 find good shoots on large potatoes, instead of pulling them off, I cut a small portion of the tuber with them, as I think they will get over the weaning process better than shoots torn from the parent; and if the tubers are then dusted with a little time or road dust, or both mixed, they will keep well for eating."
"I may be told that this method of planting potatoes is troublesome, especially when the shoots are so long. I only recommend this practice to those who happen to have potatoes, that if not used in this manner, might perhaps go to loss. When potatoes are not more than twelve inches thick on a potato house floor, their buds will be very stout; if they are taken off carefully with a little chip of the tuber, when from four to six inches long, and laid in a drill or on a lazybed ridge, they will produce an abundant crop; a compost of bog-stuff or"
"GS  coal ashes, ought to be in readiness to help them on"

Any information upon the subject, I shall be happy to afford; as I conceive it to be a duty incumbent upon us all, to disseminate those truths respecting the potato, which have been so long overlooked, or held back. Until to-day I did not see your notice of the matter, having been incorrectly informed it had not been reported."
"The ground-work of lasting good upon this subject, I conceive to be—"
1st—Proof of the nutritive properties of the produce of the potato in MEAL AND FLOUR.
"2ndly.—The quantum of produce in “nutritive material,"" derivable from a given extent of land cultivated with potatoes or grain."
"1, therefore, now give you the result of analyses obtained by the most eminent chemists, namely, that potatoes and grain divested of aqueous matter, &c., contain, of ""nutriment for animals,"" the following proportions :—"
Potatoes. Wheat.
"Sugar, starch, sum 84-08 78-20"
"Gluten, or animal matter . 14.82 17.53"
Oil .. . 4.10 4.27 100 100
"It is almost unnecessary to say that in these constituents lie the aliment essential to the production of bone and muscle, required to meet the demands of labour, as well as ample nutrition otherwise; the apparent deficiency is gluten being but two-three- fourth per cent., while that is compensated for by an increase of sugar and starch. But it is to be recollected that the principal quantum of gluten derivable from wheat rests in the bran, which forms no part of the food prepared from wheat for the use of man; and, therefore, I cannot hesitate to assert that the produce of potatoes, made according to the operations I have carried into effect, contains, at least, as much of those essential constituents, as the produce of wheat, tised as it is now for food."
But I invite reply upon a point of such paramount importance to this country.
"Now, as to"" the quantum of produce from a given extent of land,"" shall give you the results of experiments, compiled and arranged, in tabular form, by Sir Robert"
"298  Kane, which, although much under my own experience, as regards quantity from the potato, may be well to take, in the first instance, as data on a question so much misunderstood, being ‘proofs derived from various sources, and, therefore, not to be doubted. This table shows the following facts, not ascertained for any special proof as to the potato, or any other particular vegetable, but to form a just comparison between all. It is only necessary, however, to give the produce of three for my present purpose—"" the aclua nutritious material"" of which, after being divested of aqueous matter, is as follows :—."
"Wheat . . . .) 1055 Iba. Oats. . . . . 1175, Potatoes . . : . 4076,,"
"Potatoes, therefore, yield, according to these proofs nearly four times the quantity of nutriment given by wheat from a similar quantity of ground, but in practice it may be made considerably more."
"These facts you will, I doubt not see, are the true groundworks upon which we may rest the hope of changing the present wretched condition of our peasantry and, therefore, I dwell upon them, in order that the; may be well and thoroughly understood; pin order, too that those who have calumniated our "" poor potato"" maj justify their libels, or justify themselves. I war no with the dead. Cobbet, talented as he was, wrought but little evil, for his assumed proofs were proofs against him. But I would ask those who have decried the potato as wanting nutriment, fo prove the fact; and I fearlessly challenge them to do so."
"Having now shown the nutritive and productive ad vantages of the potato, it is necessary I should poin out that the process adopted by me is very different from ""Farina making."" Farina contains nothing more than the properties of starch, while the HEAL AND FLOUR OF POTATOES, prepared under my directions contain the entire nutritive value of the root, and therefore, possesses all the elements essential as a foo> for man."
"It is right I should also observe, that the process i so simple, that it can be carried into effect by the poorest cottier—a pot,.a grater, and a spade, aided by a few bags for drying the meal, are all he actually requires if he have not better. Were the peasantry of Ireland to be dependant upon machinery to lift them from their misery, -that misery would be indeed protracted—but in this case it is not so; and feeling that you will willingly lend your aid to to make known facts which concern all, who wish well to our country, or comfort to our poor. I remain, sir—"

"O  THE POTATO CROP . Farmers Gazette, June 27"", 1846, page 134"
"I beg to forward an account of what I have observed in regard to the potato crop in Devon within this last week. I have visited many potato fields, most of which have a very luxuriant and thriving appearance when seen at a distance, but on examination I find the whole to be diseased; I could not discover one not affected less or more. I fully believe that the whole I have examined will be roasted or scorched up with the direful calamity within a month of this time. I Many consi- dered their crops to be doing remarkably well, and, indeed, expressed themselves satisfied that their crops were quite clear from disease until I pointed out its effects."
"Mr. Bridle, of Otterton, called my attention to a fine piece of early potatoes, which he had planted pretty early in February last, in a sheltered dry situation: they had remarkably strong stalks, from 2 to 3 feet in height, and many of them at the base as thick as the middle finger, with foliage as large as good spinach leaves. Mr. Bridle on Monday last calculated that he should be able to take up 50 bags of good tubers from this piece in the last week in this month, and I do not doubt but that quantity would have been produced by the end of the month had they kept clear from disease, which attacked them on Thursday the 4th hist., and the whole have now dropped down dead, many of the stalks looking as if charred. 1 enclose a stalk, that you may have ocular demonstration of those facts. The effluvium is uncommonly disagreeable in this hot, sunny weather. The fact is, on my examining them I could distinctly observe that they never had been free from disease; it originated in the old tubers, which produced strong cankerous watery shoots. Your remarks, which appeared early in spring, in respect to the potato crop being doomed, is now too truly verified."
"The disease is clearly to be observed in many fields I have examined. It proceeds from the old tubers. the shoots having a sort of watery swelling near the tuber, which bursts, some of them to that extent that they at once canker off; they then shoot again and again until exhausted, still making fresh roots, which are also affected with the disease; at the same time on pulling up a strong stalk, the lowermost or first burst part, and all the roots adhering to the stalk near it, are found to be dead, and shrivelled up, while luxuriant roots above still for a while support the stalks—to all appearance at a distance in perfect health; then it makes its appearance in various forms above ground, and _ the strongest looking plants die, and are dried up in a few hours, while the very next or adjoining plant on either side escapes, and remains healthy looking, and luxuriant for perhaps a few hours or days after its neighbour is dried up and withered. Some are infected first on the stems at the base, near the surface of the ground; others a few inches higher, and some near the summit, while others are affected in five or six places at the same time. Where those gangrene sore-looking blotchings are is where the dropsical swellings before described have burst under- ground; when those places burst above ground, the stalks at once drop down dead; others are affected only for a time at first in the axils of the leaves, which on these bursting fall off, while others again are first attacked only in the"
"300  small ribs or veins of the leaves, which burst and at once cause a small blotch, which runs like wild-fire into large brown, or black, inky-looking spots. I observed in the dull sunless weather we have had, previous to the last fourteen days, that the gangrene bursted blotchings were mostly brown; but since we have had clear sunny fervid weather, they at once turn as black as if charred. The disease is also to be discovered readily enough in the young tubers, if not before being cooked it may afterwards; the feel of an infected tuber will readily convince any one, although the disease may not be visible to the naked eye until the skin is peels off; the first appearance is its peculiar white colour, almost as white as a curd, and quite as soft. In others more infected may be observed the commencement of little sore looking watery blotchings full of water, as soon as the skin is removed; while in others, this may be found burst, and the disease clearly to be seen with the naked eye, passing all through the tuber in various directions; when thus infected, they soon become putrid. Whatever may have - been the origin or first cause of this destructive disease, it is clear that it now proceeds from the tuber—that its first appearance is, if either in tuber, stalk, or foliage, in the shape of little watery spots, pimples, or bulgings, swelling into a dropsical contortion until it burst, at which time the disease runs through the crop like wild-fire, carrying rapid destruction before it. It is now almost a certainty that the whole of the crops which have been planted at the usual season, and that too without any previous preparation of the seed-tuber will be again destroyed, whatever certainty there may be with prepared seed and early planting. Autumn planting, &c., will now soon prove itself; at present I have myself fine pieces of potatoes that have not at this moment any appearance of disease; under certain preparations at the same time, others have it in every form. I would recommend all cultivators to encourage crops of carrots, parsnips, Jerusalem artichokes; to sow plenty of turnips—more par- ticularly Swede turnips, which is one of the very best of all roots for horses, cows, bullocks, sheep, or pigs; they can now be sown in seed-beds, and transplanted in the same way as cabbages, and should the potato-crops fail, good varieties of cabbage should also be selected, and sown in abundance, and it is not too late for sowing dwarf curled savoys—a most excellent vegetable to stand a severe winter, and of known good qualities for furnishing abundance of wholesome food both for culinary purposes and for cattle. It is very good boiled or steamed for feeding pigs, &c. The potato disease being thus early discovered there is ample time to crop the land with articles that may be turned to good account in winter. It is not too late to sow carrots ; I have grown excellent crops sown after midsummer. Carrots will continue to grow when sown late until December—"

"sIR— Having read your obliging notice of my letter upon the above subject, published in your paper of the 13th instant, and also the queries from your —"
"O  correspondents, ""Farina"" and ""H,"" i conceive it but right to address you in reply; particularly as it appears to me essential, in the present stage of this question, that nothing should be left undone to make its real merits fully understood."
"Permit me to say, that in bringing forward such a fact as the immense difference in the produce of flour from potato and wheat — that although I had practical proof of the average quantities in this country being infinitely more favourable to my position — I purposely took those of established authorities in preference to my own; leaving the increased quantum in favour of the potato to prove itself. I have already pointed out how this can be simply done by any farmer, and I again urge the trial in different parts of the country; to aid which I shall, as speedily as my other avocations will allow, publish full and ample directions for the manufacture of meal and flour from potatoes; which, I hope, will be such that every peasant in the country will be enabled to become his own manufacturer, on being taught the mode I shall describe."
"I am aware that an impression exists that the operation is one of difficulty, requiring machinery, &c., but this is an error. My object from the first was to make it within the reach of even the poorest cottier; and I am happy to say it is so. I cannot see why the farmer should not manufacture potato, into flour and meal; as he does milk into butter and cheese; and I vouch for it, the appliances necessary are as simple, and within reach, for one as the other. In fact, those of a dairy, with very trifling additions, will be suitable, if wished to be used, but need not be so expensive."
"I have not taken into consideration the interests of manufacturers by steam or water power; first, because their capital and usual capability places them beyond need for help; next, because I believe the preparation of the potato to be as legitimately the duly of the farmer as that of his dairy; and, as I before said, the process is within reach of all who have the covering of a house and the simplest appliances in it. Still, that it will become an article of manufacture on a large scale, cannot be doubted; and the observations of your correspondent ""H.,"" as to its permanent advantages in the workhouses of Ireland, on the score of economy, as well as employment, which would not interfere with paid labour, are truly desirable."
"But there is another reason why it should be a regular operation of the farmer. You justly remark on the evil of sending the potato off the farm, unless there be means to get back manure. By manufacturing that tuber into meal, the grower has the opportunity of obtaining the most valuable fertilizer from itself; as the soluble constituents which pass off in the operation, contain many of the main elements essential to the luxuriant reproduction of the root. Thus, home manufacture of the potato is doubly its legitimate use; and when we compare the comforts and advantages of its produce, in meal, and flour, and fecula; and think of the blessings which the great variety of food to be obtained, will confer upon those who now have it but in its boiled state, I shall not envy the feelings of any who will not give heart and hand to aid in bringing about such a change."
"302  it is strange that even in such things as this, there should be a fashion, as in dress or matters of lesser moment. But it has been long the fashion to abuse the potato, and the public has become embued with prejudices, arising from that which strikes upon the outer ear, but never reaches the mind, if mind it can be called, which forms an opinion without thought; yet this, unluckily, is too much the case; and even they, whose duty it is to think, because they profess to understand, and thus lead the public; permit their prejudices to mislead themselves; and while scoffing at an effort made to change an evil system, forget that they may perhaps perpetuate miseries, in place of extending blessings. But that these blessings will come now, I fear not; and ere many years elapse, we shall look back with as muchwonder on the simplicity which existed in using the boiled potato solely, as we now do on the use, in "" olden times,” of "" furmity"" or boiled wheat, in place of wheaten bread."
"I regret you should understand me to advocate the culture of the potato, to the exclusion of other crops. I have no such idea. On the contrary, I believe the rota- tion of crop to be the most valuable improvement in husbandry; but I wish that neither the rich farmer nor poor cottier shall be frightened from the culture of what may be made their most profitable source of employment; and to the latter, who cannot change his crop—who can get nothing but the potato—to whom he may wish, but cannot give a better food—surely we should teach all the variety and good he can get from it alone, and what is that ? As much, nay, more, nutriment he can get from grain, with not one-half the trouble and at least four times the quantity,"
"With such facts as these before you, you will-not, I think, advocate the substitution of Indian meal for the potato — a measure as impractical for a continuance as it was wise, benevolent, and good, in the recent and I present emergency. To make it the food of that portion of the people of Ireland who now live solely on the po- tato, cannot be, from the following reasons. There are 4,000,000 of our population thus situated; and medical men estimate the daily quantity of Indian meal required to be about what will cost £9 per annum to supply a single labourer. I shall, however, in order to be considerably under, reduce the average so low as £5 per head. But even so, it becomes at once apparent that TWENTY MILLIONS OF MONEY should be remitted from this country annually, to feed, on Indian corn, that 4,000,000 of our people—while the average produce of our exports is but £8,000,000, and our whole average banking- circulation the same."
"This is sufficient to prove the impossibility; but, under any circumstances, to suppose that an agricultural country such as Ireland could relinquish the culture of a food most eminently fitted for its climate, and hope to supply itself with that which will not grow here, is, indeed, chimerical; and the sooner the people are made to understand the fact, that they must depend upon what they can produce themselves, the better; for they already too widely believe that Indian corn will, in future, be supplied for their use.—"
"Yours, &c., JASPER W. ROGERS, C.E. Nottingham-street, Dublin, June 23, 1846,"
"O  P.S.—In reply to your correspondent ""Farina,"" I beg to say, that without being made fully aware of the nature of his machinery, &c., I could not instruct him properly in the alterations, &c., to be made, in order to carry on the manufacture of potato meal and flour."
"POTATO DISEASE . Farmers Gazette, June 27'"", 1846, page 139"
"sIR—As far as present appearances go, the fatal disease, called by the country people “potato cholera” is not hereditary. Much has been said and written on this head, calculated, in my mind, to do little more than deter poor people from planting the few potatoes which last year remained for such purposes, after the disease had run its course. I have been lately through the counties of Galway, Roscommon, Westmeath, Kildare, Dublin, Meath, Louth, and resident in this county (Longford), I can, now, from actual observation, and from having conversed, unreservedly, with the most intelligent practical, as well as scientific farmers throughout these counties, give a fair report of the various crops in general, but of the potato crops in particular, which, form the subject of this hastily, and, I fear, imperfectly written letter, and all agree with me, as I have already said, as far as present appearances go, we will have no ""potato cholera.” It is true, if similar causes occur this year as they did last year, we may expect similar results, that is, in as far as the habit and con- stitution of the growing crops may render them susceptible of being affected by such influence; or, on the contrary, proof against it. But as these causes are such as no human being can foresee, it would be presumption of the grossest kind to attempt to propound remedies beyond those already known from experience to be partially successful, for an imaginary evil we mayf ancy to be approaching as in the distance. But I shall not further weary you, or your readers, by such hypothetical assumptions, knowing, as I do, that one fact with you is worth a thousand unsupported statements. There is a potato starch manufactory in this town, the output from which amounted to some tons per day during the winter and spring, all of which was put out on a about three Irish acres, and so plentifully as to be two inches deep. Seed potatoes were planted, nay, pressed down into this strongly fermenting, and half decomposed mass of filth, and covered in the visual way. They grew successfully, and are now three to four inchesover ground, after being second earthed, and a more healthy crop of potatoes I have never seen at any season. It has been, by some, recommended to renew the potato crop, by obtaining fresh tubers from seed. As if by anticipation, 1 sowed in the year 1844 some seed of the old Irish white apple. I had the seed sown in the garden of Mr. Harris, at Knockmartin, (agent to the Rev. J. G. Porter, and others,) in the spring of 1845 ; the produce was planted in January, 1846, in drills, in the open ground, neither soil nor situation favourable, and the result has proved to be a healthy crop, and of early maturity, as you will perceive by the specimen I send you by the Sligo coach. you see they are well shaped, and of a ""standing yellow colour ;"" and, with your permission, I will call them Kellyites. I have said I saw no failure during the progress of my travels, nor have I heard of any having occurred anywhere, except at the"
"304  Lord Lieutenants in the Phoenix Park. I was told by one of the most talented men in Ireland, as an agricultural writer, that fifteen acres had failed there; but on a more minute inquiry I have found that the failure has been but a partial one. As a faithful chronicler of events, perhaps you would permit me to hazard a conjecture, that the failure of the potatoe crop last year, will be a decided blessing. It will give remunerative employment to "" Paddy,"" and has brought us, "" mere Irish,” so much under the notice of the world, that we shall, it is to be hoped, never to be so much neglected again by our friends at the other side of the water. If Sir Robert Peel would now introduce a suitable landlord and tenant bill, (this is no politics of a party character, for it is a matter that concerns all,') by which the land- lord could have his land improved, and the tenant reaping his legitimate share of the profits, he would do more to relieve the real distresses of Ireland, and smooth the asperities that every day meet us, whichever way we turn."
"My intimate knowledge of the state of the country, without any party bias, gives me a strong feeling in this particular, and inspires me with an ardent hope, that as agriculture is the main-stay of Ireland, ere long party differences will subside, and we shall all say with the land Commissioners, that "" It is certainly desirable that the fair remuneration to which a tenant is entitled for his outlay of capital, or of labour in permanent improvements should be secured to him, and they earnestly hope that the legislature will be disposed to entertain a bill of this nature, being convinced that no single measure can be better calculated to allay discontent, and promote substantial improvement throughout the country,""—"

THE POTATO CROP
". Farmers Gazette, June 27"", 1846, page 141"
"You have very properly cautioned some of your more sanguine correspondents against forming too premature a judgment respecting the prospects of the coming potato crop. The disease did not commence last year till the first six months were well over; one ought not, therefore, to be too hopeful should six weeks or more pass by without many indications of the malady. The specimen I enclose for you this morning, of the base of a potato stem, exhibiting precisely the appearance, of the decayed tubers of last year, though the foliage and upper portion of the stem are at present healthy, is no very pleasant indication of what may too probably be expected. The tubers are not above half grown, but the base of the stem is in such a state that the plant could not have retained its verdure for another week. In some parts the whole of the tissue between the cuticle and the spiral vessels were decayed, in others spotted with the peculiar brown patches which, in the present instance, are highly impregnated with the mycelium of some fungus. The cuticle itself was powdery with a minute fusiporium, probably identical with that which has been so common on the diseased tubers. I ought to tell you that the potatoes from which the diseased specimen originated did not exhibit last year the slightest trace of disease. I am surprised to see in the papers accounts of"

Baron Richards, over, six feet three inches high; heads large, long, healthy, and well filled. Variety "" Marsdon's, early matchless"" white. We have lately seen the crop, and I have been agreeably disappointed at not seeing it ""laid,"" from the appearance of the crop in spring; but on being told it was mown (deprived of the top leaves) in May last, together with the advantages of a dry season, satisfactorily accounted for its success. We mention this, that others having heavy crops, may adopt the same precaution, during the April and May months."
"Another variety sent us, "" Spalding's prolific,"" measuring six feet four inches, grown at the residence of Robert Disney, Esq., near Coolock, head healthy, long, and full, seed sown at the rate of 12 stone to the Irish acre, promising well."
"Oats and Barley will be much benefitted by the late rains; still the crops will be light in produce, however good in quality they may turn out to be, and this depends in a great measure on the favourableness of the harvest."
"The accounts still received from the different parts of Ireland give good hopes of success in the potato crops, with few exceptions (one of which, that made by a gentleman, a friend of ours, from Cork, who says, "" there are reports of some fields withering down."") The failure of the potato crop at the Phoenix Park, alluded to last week, by Mr. Kelly, has been but a very partial one, such as might be expected any year. We availed ourselves of the great pleasure of waiting on that excellent public officer, Mr. Wilkie, who afforded us much information on this head, which we will lay before our readers in due time."

"uP to a recent date, we, in common with many others, have looked on the potato disease of 1845 as the effect produced from a cause never, perhaps, sufficiently un- derstood, even by the most eminent botanists of the kingdom; and notwithstanding that we believed in the theory of those eminent men who have taken such pains to ascertain, philosophically, the cause, and, to a certain extent, felt disposed to rely on some of the antidotes suggested, to prevent the future progress of this disease in the crop of this year—notwithstanding that we know that a perfectly healthy animal might, with the same hope,: be expected as the offspring of parents suffering and wasting under some mortal disease, as that perfectly healthy plants could, with hope, be expected either from the seed, roots, or scions of diseased plants—and notwithstanding that we believed and stated that there were few if any potatoes perfectly free from that fatal disease, still we have endeavoured to flatter ourselves, that, under Providence, this disease would not make its appearance this season, except as a consequence proceeding from a cause, such as produced the disease last year— and we were strengthened in this hope by the very healthy appearance presented by the various crops growing under our own immediate superintendence, the splendid-looking crops of our friends, together with the flattering reports we have had from the different parts of the country, which made us look on any of a contrary nature little short of the opinion of an “ alarmist,"" or of some very nervous person too ready to draw conclusions without sufficient cause; but, alas! we, in common with many others, have permitted ourselves to rest on hopes that are not likely to be realized. We have not only permitted those placed under our direct control, with the best possible intentions, to plant an unusually large quantity of potatoes, to ordinary appearances sound, but flattered by the apparent success of the early crop produced from visibly unsound seed, we have advised others to do likewise, and it is by no means a source of gratification to us, tinder our present impression, to have done so, fearing as we do that the amount of potatoes diseased at the present moment is much greater than most people can be led to believe. We shall now proceed to give our reasons for thinking so, that others may judge of their correctness, and, if agreeing with us, that those in whose hands power lies, may, before it be too late, make some such arrangements as will in some degree be adequate to meet the forthcoming emergency."
"We have already said, that up to a late period we had flattered ourselves much on the healthy appearance of the growing crop, notwithstanding that we saw occasionally a number of curled stalks, greater than we had been wont to see, and in varieties of potatoes, scarcely ever, if at all, subject to that disease. We have endeavoured to persuade ourselves that this crispation, so called, proceeded more from the excessive drought of the months of May and June, than from any latent disease in the parent tuber, or vitiation of its sap; and we induced ourseves to hope that, on the return of moisture, a new life in the plants would be the consequence of a full reply of food, afforded by the influence of such moisture and cooled atmosphere. We have forced ourselves in some measure to forget that the variableness of our climate, and the sudden, great changes from heat to cold, from drought to moisture, and vice versa, have not only last year, but in many other years, brought on a variety of diseases, not only in the animal but in the"
"O  vegetable creation, that afterwards proved, as it were, hereditary. With all those facts so familiar to us, we had indulged in the hope, that we should, under Providence, despite the faithful predictions of the vegetable physiologist, organic chemist, and natural philosopher, have an abundant crop of potatoes; but as Providence, in His inscrutable ways, often defeats the philosopher, and disappoints his expectations, for the good of mankind, so has He permitted us to disappoint ourselves, by entertaining such a delusive hope, we had almost said, founded contrary to our own puny notions of the philosophy of plants; but we have digressed too much from our immediate subject."
"On minutely examining a great variety of potatoes, we have been able to perceive the disease, or, perhaps, a complication of diseases in a great variety of forms; first, by the curl in the leaves, produced, practically speaking by the absence of a due supply of healthy food from the diseased rootlets or feeders, and as if nature had deigned to maintain her offspring, abortive, it is ttue— a young potato is generally to be found adhering to the main stem at each joint under the surface, which young potato carries the disease to its heart's core, although possessing no visible exterior mark; secondly, in plants of a more healthy appearance, possessing an unusual number of rootlets or feeders, but remarkably short in the number of young tubers, each of which bears a number of small brownish marks on the surface of the skin, which marks, although not more than skin deep to the naked eye, can, with the aid of a good microscope, be traced through every part of the tuber; and at the heart can be discovered, by the naked eye, a fluid of an unusually dark colour, which, by the aid of the microscope again, can be traced through the entire cellular tissue; and, thirdly, in the strong, apparently healthy, but plethoric plant possessing a robust stem, and widely-spread branches with roots, rootlets, and fibres extending in all directions in search of, and apparently supplied with, a superabundance of food—the larger roots producing young stems at the different joints, familiarly speaking, like those produced by the roots of couch-grass, but without the slightest appearance of the formation of young tubers, and, on a closer examination, healthy-looking as the stalk appears to be, fungus will be found, by the naked eye, surrounding the stem at its base, and, with the microscope, will be observed, extending over the entire surface, and like in the former case of the young tuber, occupying much of the cellular tissue. As we have already hinted, we believe that every potato crop is effected more or less in one or other of these ways, and that it only requires the plants to have arrived at certain stages of their growth to make it visible to every observer. Such, at least, is our impression. We may be wrong, but right or wrong the giving expression to our views can do no harm. Our object is not to create false alarm, but to induce our readers to watch their crops minutely, and if they observe the symptoms we have, although imperfectly, endeavoured to point out, that they will remove those; plants from which nothing, or next to nothing, can be; expected, and to supply their places with something else. We cannot at this late period, say with any de- degree of certainty what may be likely to prove in any manner a substitute for the potato as Iranian food, but with some other crop that may contribute to produce beef or mutton, which, if had in sufficiency, will insure us the means of obtaining some other food as a substitute, perhaps to a// not equally palatable, yet to most people equally, if not more, nutritious."
"We are well aware that, at the present time, potatoes —even bad, unsound"
"308  potatoes—are used merely as a luxury, not only in Dublin but throughout the country. We are aware that very many men who, at one period of life, could not think of dining without potatoes, now express their determination never to eat a potato whilst price of that article remains so high, pledging themselves, as it were, against the use of them. It is always painful to a sensitive mind to be the bearer of sad intelligence. What intelligence, to an Irishman, of so sad a nature as that which we have conveyed ? But the sadness of the reflection is considerably lightened, when we look round us, and feel that we breathe in an atmosphere where the food of the people is untaxed. We now can speak of things that were, without being accused of having taken any part in the political revolutions that have taken place. Whatever the law is, we endeavour to act according to it, however we may approve or disapprove of its justice or injustice. The corn laws are now repealed. Will the prices be reduced so low as to bring on the farmers' ruin ? We believe not; we never believed they would; but even if they should become so low, we have another ""stone in our sleeve"" for that tyrant want. We have the means within our reach, by varying our systems, and making up in quantity what we lose by low price; for twenty barrels of wheat at 15s. per barrel, are better than fifteen barrels at 20s. per barrel; so let us ""be up and doing,"" for ""no good comes of idleness.”"

"SINCE our leader has been put in print, we have received the Southern Reporter, from which we extract the following letter—a letter written by an esteemed friend of ours for the Tralee Chronicle, denying the assertion that his crop had been attacked with disease:—"
To the Editor of the ' Tralee Chronicle.’
"siR—I saw, on reading your independent journalof the 27th inst., my name in giving a report of my early potato crop being diseased. I have with much pleasure to contradict said report; I neither directly or indirectly have asserted such; but in accordance with many other persons do say that I have not for many years seen the potato crops assume such a luxuriant and healthy appearance, as they do at present. In this locality, last year, |, with many of my neighbours, had to say we were providentially favoured in our potato crop being free from any disease of any signification. Hoping the same may be universally the case this year. Your inserting this will much oblige your obedient servant,"

"We have much pleasure in giving this letter, hoping that it is well founded, and that our valued friend has not been under an erroneous impression regarding his"
O  crop.
"Since we received the paper containing it, we have been through town and met several gentlemen, who one and all declare their crops to be greatly affected. We had also the pleasure of being called on by Mr. Hanly, the intelligent steward of Sir Roger Palmer, Kinnure Park, Rush, who states that his crops are much affected, but that his neighbours’ are still more so. He says that the poor people near Rush, who hitherto made their rents by the sale of early potatoes, are now, in getting out for market, leaving from one-fourth to one-half of them in the ground as worthless, as they did last year. He states, also, that an extensive farmer in his neighbourhood took out his ploughs, on last Tuesday, to earth his potatoes, and find them so deeply affected, he abandoned the work in despair; and that another tenant farmer had been busily engaged this week pulling up his potato stalks and transplanting mangel wurzel in their stead. We hope our friends through the country will state the condition of their crops."

"The all-absorbing topic, at the present time, appears to be the potato disease, which, as we last week anticipated, is now but too generally known. We have received numerous communications from different parts of lreland—from Cape Clear to the Giant's Causeway, and from the Hill of Howth to Connemara—and, with few exceptions, all bearing sad testimony of the potato failure."
"Knowing our countrymen as we so well do, we can sympathize with them to the fullest extent; and we hope they will, with us, use their strength, patience, and intelligence, in guarding against despondency, and bearing up against this temporary calamity, for it will be but temporary, and ultimately prove a blessing. It is even fortunate that it has so soon shown itself, that those in whose power, under Providence, it in to protect them, the poor, may take time by the forelock, and provide against contingency; and as Providence, in his wise dispensations, permits evils to befal us, that we may the better appreciate his blessings and be grateful for them, we should be thankful that we are not, as heretofore, in times of comparative plenty, afflicted with fever or other pestilential diseases, that swept away whole families. No, if we are to experience a temporary inconvenience, let us have fortitude in our distresses, which we, at least, do not anticipate to any great ex- tent—the more especially when we reflect on those; happy concomitant circumstances. An abundant harvest of corn and hay is everywhere expected, with very few exceptions. A new impulse is given to increased employment, and we are reaping the fruits of it; our labourers are more healthy, more vigorous, more willing, and better able to work, because they are better fed, notwithstanding that up to a very late period old potatoes were selling in Dublin at from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. per stone; but the fact is, the working people have given them up, and"
"310  hence their increased vigour, health; and ability to work. With such a fact before us, what have we to fear ? We say nothing, beyond the mere temporary inconvenience, which in a short time will be forgotten, except as a matter of history."
"We had intended saying much on the state of the crops and our prospects, but we ."
"hope the above, founded on practical observation, extended over a large tract of country in a professional way since our last, will satisfy our readers that we have no cause of alarm at least, and that present appearances, with the exception of potatoes alone, are almost everything we could wish for, and perhaps much more than we deserve."

APPEARANCE OP THE POTATO DISEASE
". Farmers Gazette, July 18, 1846, pages 185-186"
"siR — Although in last week's GAZETTE I stated that I entertained strong hopes that even the probability of the recurrence of the disease of the potato crop, which so many have justly and reasonably dreaded, was distant, I have this week to lay before your readers the painful intelligence that, before my last paper in reference to the subject was published, I was informed by a neighbouring gentleman that he was afraid there was something the matter with his early potatoes in the garden. I instantly proceeded to examine the crop, and upon doing so found that his apprehensions were too well grounded on facts, for the stalks assumed quite an unusual appearance, but similar, however, to last year's blight."
"From the diversity of opinion?—each, of course, modified by the circumstances under which the observations were made, and influenced by the effect produced by the relations which these cirrcumstances may have had to natural causes—which are entertained as to the nature and origin of the disease, it would be hazardous, and even presumptuous in me to record my own opinions on so mysterious a subject. I may, however, state what led to the entertainment of these opinions."
"When first I visited the plot of ground in question, I was alarmed at the number of stalks affected on two ridgelets, quite convenient to the centre walk of the garden. The earliest indications which manifested them seives were to be observed in the leaves, and the top of the stem, and the blotches appear to descend in the latter; for in no case which I have witnessed, either this or last year, have I found that they originate at the base of the stalk, and “proceeded upwards; this added to the circumstance, which is rather remarkable, that they have been first affected in the most exposed situations, induces me to infer that the virus or malaria, as you may be pleased to term it, has had its origin in the atmosphere, and is, therefore, derived from. that source. I will flatter myself to say, that I am not unique on the question of the source of this so-termed contagious principle, for the conclusions of not,"
"©  perhaps, the most scientific, but at least some of the most practical and acute observers of the disease, go to bear me out. It may be said, that as yet little can be known of it which would enable us to assimilate it to last year's visitation. This is very true, the season is not as yet far advanced; but the stage of its progress in the case which I have noticed, is as forward as last year's disease was on the 1st day of September, and sufficiently advanced to enable me to state, that in every particular connected with it, it is a perfect fac simile of what we have already experienced."
"As to the treatment of it, it is also absolute folly to say a word. The most prudent and consolatory suggestion, that could, perhaps, be offered, would be to adopt extreme caution in preserving the tubers, if the disease permit them to attain to that state of perfection. Let every means, therefore, for this purpose, be adopted which common sense can suggest. Some are of the opinion that we can forego the spread of the contagion, in a great measure, by cutting off the infected part of the stalk in time. I myself am an advocate for surgical operations, in this case; and, from the success which has already attended my own experience on the subject, would recommend the adoption of the plan to others, at least, upon a limited scale.—"

POTATO DISEASE— HOW TO DEAL WITH AN INFECTED CROP
". Farmers Gazette, July 25'"", 1846, page 202"
"SIR — I regret that I cannot give so favourable an account this week as I was enabled to do last week, of the state of the potato crop in this neighbourhood."
"Within the last two or three days a diseased tuber is now occasionally to be found in digging my early white Americans, a variety in which no trace of the disease was discernable at any time last season, and the produce of the diseased tubers of Cork reds (specimens of which were sent to you last April— see FARMERS' GAZETTE, vol. iv. No. 51, p. 826), is so diseased as to be utterly worthless. The crops of my poor neighbours are later than mine, and apparently safe as yet: they appear remarkably fine and healthy. The disease appears to me to be communicated through the medium of the atmosphere, by the leaves and stems to the tubers; and if I might suggest a remedy, it would be, to cut down the stems. Whenever the crop is sufficiently advanced to be worth preserving, and the disease has progressed so evidently as to endanger it, let the stems be removed from the field and burned, and the crop, if in drills, be moulded up as high as possible with the double mouldboard plough, and if in ridges let it be covered with three or four additional inches of mould from the furrows, and left until March next, sowing a spring instead of a winter crop on the soil. I did this with my crop last year: the disease was arrested at the point it had reached when the stems were cut down, and it never made further progress."

312  POTATO DISEASE
". Farmers Gazette, July 25'"", 1846, page 202"
"Sir—When blight on the chief article of the food of millions has occurred, it behoves every man in society to try every experiment to save all he can, and with a view to effect the most good I think every man ought to place his trial in the first instance, and hereafter the result, before the public, ! accordingly beg to inform you and your readers, if they think it worth their notice, that when the leaves of my potatoes became curled or withered in appearance, I tried the bulbs, and in most cases found one or two partially diseased pota- toes at the roots of each, and the remainder quite sound. Seeing, then, that the disease was still progressing from the tops to the roots, I put mowers to the tops and cut down every second ridge, remove the tops cut off, and remoulded them. I will have each alternate ridge to show me, at digging, whether I have done well or ill. I had a plurality of objects in adopting this process; first, to remove the diseased top; secondly, to stimulate new growth by remoulding, and lastly, to let clear air and full sun to those alternate ridges left untouched. I have not heard of any one ever trying the experiment, and consequently cannot quote any authority for it; but, be the result for or against, you shall hereafter know. The seed of these potatoes were from an adjoining field where not a single dis- eased potato appeared last season; they were planted whole, and only three in breadth of each ridge."
"Yours. &C., JAMES O-AUr.v, Longford, 23d July, 1846"
"P.S—Having travelled yesterday across the mountain Bide to the county Cavan, on the north side of this county, I am glad to inform you that the potatoes in the poor lands are quite safe in that district; but every field of rich soil under potatoes in other parts of the county, with very few exceptions, are turned quite black."
"POTATO DISEASE AND A SUBSTITUTE . Farmers Gazette, July 25'"", 1846, page 202"
"siR—I believe it is now generally, particularly, and universally known, and worse— felt, by all, that the potato crop is destroyed—a total failure. The sustenance for one half year of half of half of population, and the aid and assistant to other half, unprovided for. This revolution in the support and maintenance of a nation is an awful state, yet in the centre of this gastric revolution we all are this moment, and serious will be the consequences if some such mastermind as Sir Robert Peel does not make timely provision for the coming, I may say already arrived, emergency. In the electoral district where I live, every early potato field |! see, every one I hear of, are all withered, blasted, and perished, as much as they used to be in mid winter. The greatest care was taken in their planting and culture. In many cases whole potatoes taken out of pits in which no damage was seen to the potato last year, in extensive localities where the potato escaped the disease altogether last year, the same is the melancholy story in the early crop. The potatoes were a good deal grown before they were blasted, and if they are dug out at once and sold, there will be some present food, but the general opinion of the farmer is, that from the late crop, the minion (cup) and the lumper, there is little or no chance of any. I have seen several of these fields looking very luxuriant, until on a closer inspection the plague spot was manifest upon them; a black stripe on the stalk, a leaf here and"
"O  there withered, the stalk brittle, and those who are conversant with the progression of the miasma tell me that before a month the entire showing of this appearance will be level with the earth. There is no use now in complaining—it is a visitation of Providence, and our duty is to bow submissively to it, and exert the energies of mind and opportunities of time, land, and climate, which we possess, to remedy this coming evil of a starving people, if preparation is not made in time. Fortunately a great breadth of turnips has been sown; much of them can be appropriated directly to human sustenance, the end and object of all agriculture; the rest can, and probably will be applied to the fattening of sheep and horned cattle, and for the dairy; in some degree enabling the farmer to pay his rent, labourers, charges, &c., from another source besides corn, which can, at least (some of it) where the turnip is cultivated, be appropriated for human maintenance, and if government Poor Law Unions, or others, would construct cheap grinding mills, and erect them in a cheap manner in every electoral district, it would facilitate the use of corn for domestic purposes. It is not too late yet, by any means, to sow the white kinds of turnips, and abundant time to sow rape, the directions for which are given in your ""Tract on Green Cropping.” Our people uneducated mostly—badly educated at best, do not look forward, and make preparation in time. The educated man, the Scotchman, if you will, meditates, thinks, compares, calculates, decides, on the best, and energetically, and without losing precious time, which cannot be recalled, acts. A lea field, such as poor pasture, what I call the starvation crop, if ploughed now into wide beds, manured with four, five, or six bushels of bones, half the weight of the bones of sulphuric acid, mixed with three times their weight of water, and the bones dissolved in it, then 100 times the acid's weight of water added, all thrown on a heap of ashes or earth, spread ou the surface and the ground hacked or well harrowed; the seed sown and covered from the trenches will enable the farmer who does so, to fatten sheep, to keep more cows, and, therefore, to have more corn for home use."
"The finest crop of turnips I saw last year (about sixty acres) was grown on land broke up from lea from May till July inclusive. In ploughing, a light sod was taken first, then covered with a heavy sod. A shallow drill opened with a stripped plough, the guano, bones, &c., spread, then a light covering so as not to disturb the sod underneath. Finer crops, from this management, I never saw. Any person who so late in the year wishes to follow this plan, and to multiply his means to pay rent and charges by fat- tening sheep and cattle, has not a day, an hour, a moment, to lose, nay, he should work night and day, and I can tell them it is done. Some years ago ray son was tra- velling, by night, in Upper Canada, and from the waggon he saw light moving up and down and going on at a slow pace; he got out, walked to where it was, and saw it was for men who were working by torch light, cutting buck wheat, which being ripe the capsules would open in the day and they would to be all lost. It is probable that some of these men were from Paddy's land, and if this can be done anywhere, by any men, I can see no reason why Irishmen should not do so, if it is for their good. Although it is late, still, ""better late than never."" Rape seed can yet be sown for transplanting into stubbles, a little dung or ashes should be put into the ground, and when planted in the stubble, dung, or its substitute put to each plant. We must be up arid doing—and, if farmers are true to themselves the calamity now hanging over them may be the cause of good and not of evil."
Preparation can now be made for the ensuing year's crop. I hear from the people
"314  that the old people told them that in their youth they lived much on peas ground and mixed with oatmeal. I believe a pea for this purpose is much cultivated in Scotland; and directions for the cultivation and the import of the seed would be a desideratum. There is a plant which is as common in America and Canada as the potato in Ireland, though I by no means expect it will answer all the purposes of the potato, still it would aid with other things, namely, the pumpkin. Directions for its culture, as much suitable as possible to the working man, would be of use, and the quantity of edible fruit from a given quantity of land would be a guide. I have a few plants growing luxuriantly without glass ever since they were in full leaf. Directions for dressing it would be wanted, as well as its culture. This information would be easily got by persons who have friends in these countries. Not only some - thing must be done, but everything must be done in this crisis. Your next GAZETTE will abound with suggestions and information on the best mode of supplying the present total loss of the food of a whole people; that is, if the entire of the country is circumstanced, and I much fear it is, as I know it to be in my own vicinity. Some time since I read a work, “Travels,"" I think, ""in the Oregon Territory, or over the Pampas,"" where the traveller mentions a plant which constituted the food of the people, growing spontaneously, about the size of a well"
"grown onion. Perhaps some person may light upon the work and describe the plant, ."
"and should it be suitable for the food of our people its introduction might be of value. Jerusalem artichokes, though very inferior to the potato, might be grown extensively as another aid to supply the blank now in our vegetable food. It is easily cultivated, and grows weil on poor land. The leaves give great abundance."
"I throw out these few hints hoping that those who know more and better will suggest remedies, and that your next and future GAZETTE will contain many such."

"O  Most of those who speak of early potatoes say, that when they began to dig them at first, they were perfectly sound, but as they advanced to maturity became all, more or less, tainted, although left in the ground, others recommend leaving them in the ground undug."

"Sir—in consequence of the alarming accounts of the potato disease. I made enquiries of several persons who are digging early potatoes in the neighbourhood of Tuam, and I have met with but one person who has found a tainted potato. This person, although digging for a fortnight, has met with but two diseased potatoes; and it is remarkable, that in the place he has been digging, the leaves of about five perches were very much curled. I have tried potatoes in numerous places, some the produce of diseased apples sown whole—pinkeyes, lumpers, lad/fingers, ashleaved kidneys, and several other varieties—they were all sound, I heard at the stage between Tuam and Galway, that potatoes aside so unfit for even cattle, have vegetated and that the helpers had actually breakfasted from their produce that morning. In places where I heard there had been a rot, I made inquiries on the spot, and I could not find that a single rotten potato had been dug in that quarter.

"SIR — My attention having been drawn to a paragraph in a recent number of your publication, which states that Professor Liebeg has discovered that soot is a perfect antidote to the potato disease, I conceive it but right, under the existing circumstances, of the evil (which, permit me to say, I pointed out the certainty of to the government of this country in September last), to state that several months since I laid before the leading authorities, both government and otherwise, of this country and England, facts incontrovertible, showing the properties and action of charcoal or carbon upon the disease of the potato, both as a preservative in pit or store, and as a manure for the healthful reproduction of the tuber. Many papers written upon the subject were that CARBON is the only antidote to the disease!"
"I cannot but feel proud that I am thus upheld by an authority so truly eminent; but I have to regret that so long a period has been allowed to elapse without the promulgation of a fact such as this, so deeply affecting all classes of the community."
"Under existing circumstances I do not feel it right to enter into the details set out in my papers the causes and effect of the action of charcoal on the disease of the potato. But I should be culpable, indeed, if I held back one moment longer the two following facts; for they deeply concern some millions of the poor; and, without hesitation, I challenge proof to the reverse of what I state."
"The diseased potato may be almost entirely preserved from the effect of decomposition, by using pulverized peat or wood charcoal—abundantly interposing it between the layers and in the interstices—in pitting or storing, the pit or store being, of course, properly ventilated."
"The action is thus: the charcoal absorbs the overabundant moisture, the attendant of the disease, and instantly corrects the putrescent matter which it largely contains; therefore, effectually protecting the whole from infection or contagion, or the evil action of heated moisture."
"©  As a manure for the potato, the action of charcoal, then properly applied, is as follows:—It absorbs from the seed (which, tender existing circumstances, must be more or less diseased, no matter how attended to, or where occured in Europe) that over-moisture already named; and instantly correcting all putrescence, it leaves the oil around uncontaminated, to act with purity upon the growth; yielding to the plant. abundantly, that of which he disease has robbed it—CARBON, and thus supplying a nutriment which constitutional weakness (its real malady) essentially requires."
"These are the main causes and effects of charcoal upon the potato disease; and knowing them to be incontestible, I should feel unjustified in longer withholding their publicity, the more particularly as Professor big has now, it appears, stamped the facts with his high authority, which, so long since, have been proved by so humble an individual as myself."
"It is but right to add, that peat charcoal can be had to any extent from the bogs of Ireland, at a cost of no consideration; and that its value as a manure generally will be found of the highest consideration, I have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servant,"
"JASPER W. ROGERS, C.E. Nottingham-st., Dublin, July 28, 1846."
THE POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, August 8'"", 1846, page 236"
"SIR—It is painful to look at some of the potato fields in this neighbourhood, as every day furnishes fresh proofs of the steady progress of the distemper. On the 4th inst. I noticed it first in a low sheltered situation, in a northern aspect. The stalks are now withered, and the disease spreading by degrees to the higher ground. On the 25th inst. I planted two stalks with large balls of earth between two rows of infected potatoes: I gave them a good watering, and although they appeared to be healthy when I put them there, some of their leaves were infected on the evening of the same day, and continued getting worse every day. I kept a beautiful potato plant under a hand glass at about ten perches from the diseased plot. I took off the glass for about twelve hours, after giving the plant a good watering; I covered the plant again, but it was too late, it caught the distemper while uncovered, and is now ready to break off near the top. I have other potatoes under glass with a little air near the bottom—they are safe as yet, but I know if I uncover them they will become infected, for there is an effluvia from the first infected plot being quite sufficient to infect a whole district. Every field in this neighbourhood that I visited shows shows some slight symptoms of the disease."
"It is universally supposed by the people about here that the disease cane first with the rain, but now I believe that one field infects another."
I have a small field that was planted in drills last October; the crop has nearly
"arrived at perfection, and I believe there is not twenty bad tubers in the field. This is owing to the drills baring a very acute angle on the top to throw off the wet. |"
"318  proved this last year, and entreat of those who have drills to close them round the stems, it will save the tubers from the rot, for it is well known where there was a thick covering of duckweed growing over the potatoes last year, the tubers were"
"_safe, though the stem and leaf was rotten. There is great reason to suppose that the poison is conveyed to the tubers by rain—"

‘POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, August 8'"", 1846, page 236"
"Sir—On the 30th July I mowed off the tops from two ridges of potatoes, -planted in March last—one pinkeyes, the other cups. At that time the tops and leaves were but slightly tinged with the prevailing blackish spots. I examined the tubers at the same time, found all the cups sound, and as we were digging the others for use, I found them also all safe, excepting about one or"
"two in a basketful. I have again examined them this day, and find the cups, |"
"from which the stalks were cut, are damaged—the adjoining ridge, left uncut, quito safe still—and in the pinkeyes the disease has certainly, during the week, made more rapid progress in the cut ridge than it has in the adjoining uncut one."
"I examined them at 12 o'clock this warm day, and what I considered very singular was, that the part of the stalk remaining in the ground, from which the top had been cut, had exuding from the wounded part a large quantity of moisture, or sap, so much so, as to keep the soil for an inch or two near it quite moist."

"ALL, doubts being now at an end, even in those whose sanguineness, scepticism, or pugnacity, had superinduced them, regarding the state of the potato crops— nine-tenths of the early portion being now gone, and no reasonable hope whatever now entertained of being able to save the remaining one-tenth, or even a lesser - part of the late crop—it is useless to say more than that sacrifices of an unparalleled kind have been made to plant it, but of its produce little can be expected. There is no use in mincing the matter; the disease is doing its work so completely, nay, has done it so effectually, that even were it to stop now, there is not one month's wholesome provision in Ireland, amongst those whose diet has been the potato,"
"O  and whose drink, the water. What is to be done ? Lord John Russell it is true has moved that ""a sum of £175,000 should be voted for the payment of exchequer bills, and, also, that a sum of £50,000 should be voted to defray the expenses of public works in the poor districts of Ireland."" What on earth does his lordship mean by "" the poor districts of Ireland ?"" Every district in Ireland is steeped to the lips in poverty at the present moment. Never, in all our scenes of misery, did we, nor could we, form a conception of poverty such .as that which now everywhere meets us. We need not go to Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Connemara, Mayo, Clare, Iveragh, Bantry, Pebble O'Keefe, or to any other mountainous or uncultivated district for it, where famine and pestilence have been periodically witnessed; but let us take a short walk through the fertile fields of Fingal, the granary, if we may so Call it, of Dublin, and there we will find ""a poor district."" Let it not be supposed that this is an attempt at overdrawn picturing. The potatoes in this rich locality, that hitherto were the mainstay of the farmers at this season, are not worth the labour of digging out and sending to market, notwithstanding that the prices in the market, where the poor are in the habit of buying, are as high as thirteen pence a stone, 8s. 8d. per cwt., or £8 13s. 4d. per ton."
"How, it may be asked, will those hitherto industrious and independent farmers pay their rents, meet their numerous other engagements, and employ the people ? We answer, 'they cannot do either the one or the other beyond the first half year's rent, which they will probably pay by the sale of their wheat, a portion of which, as self preservation being the first law of nature, they must retain for the support of their families. But will they employ labourers ? They will not, they cannot. Yet in that very district, rich and fertile as it is, thousands of pounds could be expended in profitable employment of the people—not so much in building piers, establishing safety harbours, or sinking rivers, but in the simple draining of the land, requiring no very expensive government staff, possessing as it does, and as Mr. Lambert,"
"' whose letter we beg to point to, so justly says, stands sufficiently high to afford a fall for the water sufficient to give abundant employment for years to come."
"We have taken the most favourable and the most favoured district in Ireland to show the state of destitution to which the country, before many months elapse, will be reduced, if some decisive, wise, and prudent steps be not promptly taken by the government and the people to avert the calamity that otherwise must inevitably befall us, and in speaking thus, we but echo the sentiments of thousands of Irishmen who really know and can justly fee! the position we are likely to be placed in. Yes, we have lying before us letters from all parts of Ireland, from men of the highest as well as the middle station of society—from men of all shades of politics, Whig, Tory, Radical, and neutral—and from clergymen of every religious persuasion—all, all agreeing in the views we have so long since given expression to, and encouraging us in the course we are now pursuing."
"""£30,000 for public works in the poor districts of Ireland"" will be no more felt than fifty drops of water could be missed out of the ocean. We, therefore, in common with the other branches of the press, beg respectfully to warn the government, to warn the executive, and to warn all in whose power it is, to aid in meeting with a hold front the enemy that is fast approaching us. Let us strangle him whilst we have strength to do so; let not famine paralyze our power, and demoralize our conduct, rendering us an easy prey to every species of attack—the worst of all will"
"320  be those of our own passions, ungovernable and uncontrolled when cast into the chaos of starvation."
"Our charitable English friends may tell us that the landlords should be taxed to support the starving poor, and that we should not, like beggars, be annually hawking our wants and exhibiting our sores to create or excite the pity of themselves and our Scotch neighbours. To thesé good-natured friends we feel grateful for every kind favour they confer on us; nay, for every sentiment of sympathy they express towards us—nor were we ever in a position in which our gratitude, esteem, and affection, could be more easily secured than at the present moment. But, whilst we express our deep sense of gratitude for all past favours, whether they have been real or supposed, we cannot, even in our poverty, forget that, great as those boons bestowed on us have been in the eyes of our English and Scotch friends—that Ireland and the Irish contribute a revenue over one million annually, exceeding the expenditure of the country. Give us but that million, not as a boon, but as a matter of right, and we shall not be very troublesome to you for this early part of the season. Lend us another million or two to improve our lands and employ our people, but don't imagine we shall take it for the purpose of giving rich births to those whom you'll send over to swallow up what should be employed in feeding the people. WE shall repay it in due course, giving fair interest for it. We know how to apply it, and the names of those we shall hereafter submit will be a guarantee that its application shall not be _ construed into “an Irish job,” nor, what is still worse, an English or Scotch job."
"Sinoe tho above waa put in type we have seen the heads of a bill, introduced into parliament to meet the coming emergency. As far as our opinion of the same bill goes, much good as it is calculated to produce, it will fall far short of meeting our wants; we shall look more into it."
GOVERNMENT WORKS
"During our late visit to Limerick we had the pleasure of meeting an old and highly esteemed friend, Mr. Boyan, the resident engineer on the crown lands in the counties of Cork, Kerry, and Limerick, who so ably manages the mountain lauds at King William's town, and our pleasure at meeting him was enhanced on finding him employed, designing and executing public works to afford employment for the poor and distressed artisans of Limerick, on the government property there, called the King's Island. We visited the work in company, with this excellent and efficient public officer, and so much pleased were we with the result of his valuable labours, that we then requested he would kindly give us a short description of the work, as our own time was then too limited to take notes sufficiently satisfactory to ourselves and the public, many of whom, we have reason to know, will be much interested in a description of the work that they may, in some mea- sure, copy after it. We have this morning been favoured by the receipt of his note, containing all we wanted; but we must have a Woodcut prepared to give any adequate idea of the utility and superior execution of the embankment."
O  FOOD FOR PIGS
"Farmers Gazette, August 22"", 1846, page 267"
"SIR—At this unpropitious period, when the saddening prospects of the potato crop threatens concomitant evils of such awful magnitude, it would I think, be an unpardonable violation of the laws of humanity, to look on with indolent listlessness at the dreadful ravages committing by this disease, without employing every energy, however feeble, if not to arrest its progress— which I fear is now hopeless—at least to alleviate its dire consequences, by every means which human ingenuity is capable of suggesting. Impressed with such feelings myself, I beg permission to obtrude on your notice, a few remarks, not remotely unconnected with the subject."
"To find a substitute for the potato, that would answer all its useful purposes, or indemnify the cultivator for this years loss, is, I fear, beyond reach; but, as it is to be hoped, we shall live for another season, notwithstanding the ghastly spectres that stare us in the face, I think that, by setting our wits to work, we shall, under divine providence, find substitutes enough for our old and faithful friend, the potato, even though total extinction were its ultimate doom—an event which I by no means anticipate."
"One important service rendered to this country by the use of potatoes, exclusively of their value as human food, was the feeding of pigs. At the digging out of every crop, a great proportion of the small tubers, and not unfrequently whole crops, were selected and set aside for that purpose; and in this point of view alone the small farmer and cottier will grievously feel the loss of the potato crop; more especially the latter whose only property—his pig—was fed from the produce of his rack- rented rood of conacre, and often better than himself. Now when such struggling individuals as those shall find feeding for these animals, and how bacon can be supplied to the tables of the more opulent classes, at a reasonable rate, or hold its position as an article of commerce, are questions that appear to be well worthy of consideration. To feed pigs on corn, or any other of our cultivated crops, at a time when so many millions of human beings must inevitably become consumers, or starve, would appear to be an egregious misapplication of food, which could not be afforded; seeing the great breadth of land that corn and other crops occupy, and the small quantity of food they produce, as compared to potatoes."
"I am long a convert to the creed that teaches to make the greatest possible use, with the least possible expense, of the means within our reach; in other words, to strain our utmost endeavours in developing our recourses, and cultivating such raw materials as we may find ready to our hands."
"Guided by this principle, it has heretofore often occurred to me, that from one of our own native plants— the common sowthistle (Sonchut Oleraceus) an excellent feeding for pigs might be supplied, which could be had in abundance, by subjecting the plant to a judicious system of cultivation."
"My reading is not extensive enough to convince me, that the cultivation of this plant has not been recommended by others already; if it be so, I at least am not aware"
"322  of it; and were it not for the momentous crisis we have arrived at, when no idea, suggestive of good, should be for a moment withheld, I should myself perhaps consider the subject too ludicrous for grave consideration."
"-[ however cannot be easily persuaded, but that at least a mixture of this plant, with other more substantial ingredients, as experience may direct, would feed and fatten pigs in the absence of potatoes. I should suppose it to be a law of nature— though chemistry be opposed to the argument—that whatever be the food, that animals of the brute creation relish and feed upon with avidity, must be nutritious; they having nothing but instinct to guide them in their choice. Now it is almost universally known -that pigs are exceedingly fond of sow thistle—hence, |"
"presume the name— LOUDON says, (Ec p. 668,) that ""it is said to be eaten by |"
"goats, sheep, and swine,"" and every farmer in the country can bear testimony to this; then why not a plantation of this plant for pigs, as well as clover for other animals. It bears second cutting too, and what may be accounted better, can be sown, I fancy, in different successions through the spring and summer months. The plant grows spontaneously in most hedge rows and headlands in the country, and is a weed often troublesome to the farmer and gardener, amongst their cultivated crops. A description of it here, is therefore unnecessary, but will be found in any of the standard works on British botany—Hooker's for instance, (page 341.) ‘Suffice it to say, that it belongs to the class and order, Syngenesis Equalis, of Linneas, and to the Composites, of De Candolk. Its leaves are large, smooth, and succulent, emitting a milky juice from the cut or wounded parts; and its flowers resemble those of the dandelion, but smaller; being compound with the florets ligulate, (strop shaped) and the colour yellow."
"Most of our best fruits and vegetables, even potatoes themselves, have been originally wild plants of little importance in their native soil, and owe their present state of perfection to the improvement wrought in their culture by the hand of man. May we not therefore hope, that the plant in question will hereafter contribute its moiety too, to the benefit of man—for which end all things are destined—if we but take it into our fostering care, and teach it to administer to a portion at least of our approaching wants."
"At present I cannot speak practically on the subject, but am determined to enable myself to do so at some future period. I shall try the experiment myself, and my chief object now is, to stimulate others, at this pressing crisis, to follow my humble example, and prepare by collecting the seeds before the time shall pass by. I have already a small plantation of such plants as I have found straggling about my garden, and which I have reason to believe, are produced from the early shedding of this last summer's seeds; with these, however, I do not expect much success. I have also collected a quantity of seeds which I intend to make different sowings of, from this to the first of October, as well as other different sowings in spring; and if I shall be fortunate enough in raising a sufficient number of plants for my purpose, I shall try the culture in different ways, and follow up my experiment, step by step to the end. Then if I am doomed to disappointment, and that I find myself pursuing only a phantom, I shall console myself with the reflection that my object was beneficent, and shall bear the ridicule I shall have earned as stoically as I can—"
"Q  Yours, &c., PROSPECTUS."
"P.S.—There is some difficulty in collecting the seed; in consequence of the pappus or down which adheres to them iii a sessile form, being apt to fly away and carry the seeds with it at the slightest breeze or touch. The plan I adopt is, to take a paper bag, such as are used in the seed shops, in my left hand, with its mouth or opening extended. I then nip off the peduncle or flower stalk, with the globe of seeds I want to gather attached to it, and turn it quickly into my paper bag ; by this means, any quantity of seeds may be easily gathered without any waste."
PEOPLE'S PROSPECTS
"Farmers Gazette, August 22""4, 1846, page 267"
"Sir—It is impossible that any one can put away from him the fearful prospects that are at present spread before the view of the people of this country. The potato crop is universally believed to be a dead failure. The oat crop (taking into consideration the badness of the grain), even if it were well got together, would not be half a crop; whilst the badness of the weather makes the saving of it very doubtful. There is little barley grown, and it is generally reported to be bad. Wheat alone is an average crop."
"The small farmers of the country are very generally in debt since last season, the failure of their potatoes obliging them to either to use the corn that was to pay their rent, or, in case they paid their rent, to go in debt for food. But the visitation of God, though severe enough in itself, seems likely to be aggravated by man; and the difficulties that beset the country, seem to be the opportunity for class to array itself against class, so that the community, it is to be feared, will devour itself."
"My belief is, that the destitution which last season threatened the labouring population, will, this year, involve the whole farming population in a total ruin. Besides all this, every means was used to raise the price of labour on the farmer, so that, with diminished value for his produce, he had increased cost in its production."
"I fear the recommendation of leading politicians to get rid of the small farmer of Ireland, and to substitute them with large farmers with capital, is being followed out too faithfully, and that those who should foster them, are endeavouring to entice them, by giving high wages to labourers, and increasing rather than relieving their difficulties as farmers, to leave the plough and rake to the spade."
"And with this aggravation that government has adopted a course, as they themselves acknowledged, calculated to lower the value of their produce, in the passing the corn law, and in the means which for the last year they adopted to relieve the labouring population, laid by far the heaviest burden on the land; and is to be feared they will do so again. For on the farmer fell the increased poor rate, the increased cess for public works; and above all, the great depreciation in the"
"324  value of corn, by the competition of the Relief Committees, by which means not only was food lowered to our own poor, but equally to the foreigner, who had, I deeply regret to observe, a spirit of utter want of sympathy with the farmer, both on the part of the landlords and the lower orders, and a desire to extract from that one class, and they the chief sufferers from bad crops, what is to supply all the wants of the other two."
"In conclusion, I beg to observe, that I do not think that Relief Committees will this year work as well as the last. A large class of men are of opinion that the price of food was run much too low, and such will not place their money or their time again, at the disposal of the government: besides this, as want will probably set in much earlier this year, what the farmer's scanty produce will not have been generally dis- ~ posed of; all who side with them will oppose running down the price of their corn, which would be utter ruin to them. :"
"1 do not venture to propose any remedy, but write thus much, in the hope that it may awaken attention to some of our national difficulties, which is the first step towards meeting them—"
"Yours, &c., OBSERVER, Gorey, August 18, 1846."
"SUBSTITUTE FOR POTATOES Farmers Gazette, August 22"", 1846, page 268"
"sIR — I believe it is now admitted that the culture of the potato in this country to any extent must be abandoned, at least for the present. Being one of the class of farmers in this county who have cultivated this crop as the manured and cleansing one of the rotation, as best adapted for that purpose, from the facility of sale in the Dublin market, and of drawing manure thence in return, turnips or other green crops have not entered into my rotation; and to change to them now for the ensuing spring crops cannot be thought of, from the high price of store stock, and the probability of losses likely to be sustained from the, I regret to say, too prevailing and continued disease in cattle. An immediate change, therefore, to that system is not, I fear, advisable, even if means admitted. My rotation has been—"
"1.Potatoes, manured with from 70 to 90 tons, per Irish acre, of mixed Dublin dairy- yard dung, and farm-yard manure ; average produce 15 tons per acre."
"2.Wheat, from 13 to 18 brls., of 20 st. per acre."
"3.Barley, from 20 to 22 bris., of 16 st. per acre."
"4.Grasses and clover, twice mowed for hay, from 6 to 7 tons per acre"
"5.Ditto, pastured."
"6. Oats, from 16 to 20 bris., of 14 st. per acre; and then a deep ploughing in autumn, for potatoes in the spring."
"I have now upwards of 20 acres, No. 6 in this rotation, from which the oats are just reaped. What am to do with them ? A theorist friend to whom I applied for"
"O  advice, said, ""Sow oats, it is better food than potatoes. Though agreeing in the conclusion, I think you will scarcely confirm the advice, at least as far as regards this No. 6 land. Some, more practical, advised me to plough in 30 tons of good farm-yard manure per acre (which I have ready), and sow wheat, to follow with barley laid down with grass seeds for two years, and that the land will not be injured by that course, until preparation is made for the consumption of turnips on the farm, or until it be known whether the potato culture may be resumed in a year or two again as before. Your advice, under these circumstances, would be very useful to me and a large class of farmers in this county, particularly as regards the management now of the No. 6 division, and I know it will be very cheerfully given. I have no doubt you will condemn the rotation hitherto adopted altogether, but local and other circumstances induced me, for many years, to pursue it. The unfortunate state of our main crop in it for the last two years, and the necessity of abandoning it now, forces the consideration of what change is to be adopted. Many of us are bewildered on this point; but I am sure that you and some of your numerous intelligent practical correspondents will assist us in determining on a change which may, perhaps, produce good out of this distressing visitation—"
"Yours, &c., A COUNTY DUBLIN FARMER. August 19, 1846."
"[Your system of agricultural rotation of cropping would be considered not a good one by those who are ignorant of the circumstances of the County Dublin farmers; but we, knowing as we do so much of the same, would be far from pronouncing such an opinion."
"Your ""theorist"" friend's advice, we think, you were quite right in at once rejecting; that of a ""practical"" friend we would be willing to subscribe to; but it strikes us that a good crop of beans or peas, or both mixed, would be found ultimately more advantageous. There is a danger of your wheat not succeeding well on laud so freshly dunged: we mean, there is a danger of your having a bad sample, the more especially if the season does not prove very propitious before and at harvest time."
"By getting in a drilled crop of beans and peas, you can have a stolen crop of turnips, sown in June between the drills, just as is done by Mr. Hewitt Davis on his celebrated farm near Croydon. The leguminous crop will be off in time to give the turnips room to grow well, and all can be off quite time enough to put in a wheat crop in October, 1837."
"We intend adopting this ourselves in the Co. Kildare. We shail be much obliged to our practical friends for their opinions on these subjects. Could we but ""weather out"" this, the greatest calamity that has ever befallen us, at least as far as our immediate wants are concerned, we have no doubt that hereafter we shall have a more happy time in the cultivation of other than our hitherto favourite potato crop.]"
326  EMPLOYMENT OF THE PEOPLE
"Farmers Gazette, August 22""7, 1846, page 268 TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD JOHN RUSSELL."
"My LORD—The apparent apathy of the executive and the legislature with respect to the impending famine in Ireland should induce those who are aware of the fearful extent— beyond all precedent within the memory of man—at which it is likely to arrive (unless the most extraordinary exertions are used, under Providence, to avert it. I implore that you, my lord, as her Majesty's first and most responsible minister, will not allow the. present parliament to break up without affording full powers to the executive to do all which may be possible to assuage the dreadful calamity of famine and its consequents. :"
"There is, my lord, no occasion for delay as to inquiry with regard to the loss of the potato crop, which, in many cases, is gone altogether; and, I fear, in all, going so rapidly, that a great portion of the population are at the present moment enduring a wretched existence, from bad and insufficient food. May not the nations of Europe ask is this an integral portion ? Is this the nursery for the men at arms of the mightiest empire of the world ?"
"Let us pray that the Almighty, through the instrumentality of an influential, powerful, and energetic executive, may enable this country to be spared from the demoralising effects of gratuitous relief, which must be afforded, if works the most extensive in their operation be not immediately carried out throughout the kingdom."
"That there should be an abundance of food through the instrumentality of free trade, will make the calamity more irksome to an unemployed population without the means of purchasing it. The first question that arises, then, is, how are the distressed to be employed ? :"
"From the present moment to the period when the cereal crops are secured (which, as the harvest will be an early one, may be accomplished by the 1st of October), there will be sufficient time for the formation of a setter and more extended machinery, which is absolutely necessary for the effectual carrying out of public works. :"
"From the 1st of October the unemployed season will commence, as there will be no potato crop to secure. Then it is that a fearful responsibility will rest upon who- ever administers the affairs of this great empire, if a sufficiency of employment be not afforded, and if starvation and anarchy present themselves! Yes, my lord, distress! dire distress ! may be upon us before precautionary measures are adopted! . But still the question is not answered—how are the distressed population to be employed, except in making new lines of road, and improving old ones by cutting hills and filling hollows, by lowering the beds of rivers and streams, the levels of lakes and turloughs, making main vents, draining and reclaiming bogs and wastes, and making and building fishing piers, stations, and quays. Yes! all those works should be carried out as far as is practicable and advantageous"
"O  during the winter —but I fear they will- not, under all circumstances, afford adequate employment during that season, and work should be sought for that can be more advantageously carried on and more applicable to the season, and those other works kept in store till the period when he next crop is sown."
"The only work which can afford adequate or remunerative employment is thorough draining, and that upon he lands requiring it in each locality or barony; baronies not standing so much in need of it (of which there are few) should get more than a proportion of the other works mentioned, or should be employed in subsoiling. I do not mean the thorough-draining of wastes or bogs, but draining the wet lands now in cultivation, or pasture, on each man's holding or farm. Let it not be said that the main drainage must first be carried out, as there is a sufficient quantity of wet land lying sufficiently high to employ the distressed population for years to come."
"As the calamity, it is to be feared, will be general, so must the application in the way of remedy be general. The question, therefore, being, what work is it that will afford the most general remunerative employment during the winter? The answer is, thorough-draining; and one should object unless they can propose a work of qood utility, and as well calculated to bring employment home to the door of every man. A question then arises as to the detail and capital necessary: there is no time for delay, and extraordinary extigencies must be met by extraordinary exertions. It is not to be expected that Irish landowners can, under the present aspect of affairs, advance money to meet so great a call; and although the government may be ready to advance money to them for the purpose, still the application would be partial, or, in other words, employment would not be equally and generally diffused. Let the work, then, be put in progress—let the improved value the land be afterwards ascertained by commission, and argued upon it. It is not by grants of a few hundred thousand pounds that such works can be accomplished! Millions will be required! But, my lord, there is no alternative between such expenditure, and famine with its consequents!"
"I have the honour to be, mylord, your lordship's very obedient, and very humble servant,"

"THE question that everywhere meets us, that every one puts to us, and that we put to every one—what shall we do to substitute the potato?—is one the solution of which, to use a hackneyed phrase, occupies our thoughts by day, and our dreams by night. Yes, next to our duty to Divine Providence, that is the thought which is uppermost in our minds morning, noon, and night; but how to solve it is the difficulty of all difficulties, in a country such as we so well know—lreland is. Had we the means of purchasing even one half year's provision, the means of meeting our"
"328  liabilities, increased by last year's misfortunes, and the means of giving wages for labour, we do believe our case would be ultimately benefitted by this visitation; but we have not any such means. It is true, as we said last week, that government appears ready and willing to do everything in their power, despite tho opposition and threats of some well-meaning, but ill-advised small section of the English press, to afford employment to those whose fate it is to be mere daily labourers; of whose condition we never had so much apprehension as we had, and still have, regarding the farmers of every grade, except those whose lands have been in pasture, but whose condition, also, owing to the cattle distemper, despite high prices, is not as enviable as all may, at first thought, be led to suppose; but the working farmer, who lives by the cultivation of his land, whether on a large or on a smail scale, is the man that our attention must now be turned to. What is he to do ? What can he do ? He is paralyzed in every nerve; his muscles, if we may be permitted to speak figuratively, are as rigid and contracted as if the frozen hand of death had got him in its grip. His arrears hang on him, and still further liabilities are accumulating; his landlord, with perhaps a load of debt hanging over himself, has not the power to indulge, much less to aid him—no matter how indulgent or kind-hearted the same landlord may be, for his liabilities, too, are accumulating, and will still further accumulate, by the operation of the acts that are brought to bear on the landed property, for the support of the destitute, and employment of the working labourer."
"We last week hinted our fears that the relief about being afforded would fall short of its expected efficacy; and the more we consider it, the more those fears alarm us. We hinted at the danger of having the relief intended much lessened, by the support of the heavy staff machinery that government, in its' wisdom, will feel it ne- cessary to employ. We hinted that we could supply names, whose station would be a guarantee against fraudulent jobbing, whether it be Irish, English, or Scotch. The names we will now give, all must admit, are those that must be above suspicion; they are born for the people, they live for the people, and they must die under an awful responsibility, the conception of which can only be entertained by one of themselves—we mean the clergy, of every denomination. Those are the staff who know the people; who have hearts to feel for their wants, with which none else can be so intimately acquainted, and, as a consequence, can, better than any others, know how to redress them. We again call on the government—we call oil the executive, we call on the landed proprietors, we call on the middle men, we call on the working farmers, large and small, to consider before it be too late, the nature of our humble suggestion. Let a loan-fund be established in every parish in Ireland, to be supplied with a capital adequate to meet each contingency, and to be applied in such a manner as each respective case may imperatively demand. Do this in time, and there shall be nothing to fear of pestilence, famine, anarchy, or ruin. If you do not, or something very like it, you will meet one or all of the aforesaid evils. It may, as we have no doubt it will be, said, that dissensions, bickerings, or ill-blood may be engendered by the collision of such parties—that sectarian differences, prejudices, and partialities, would be the consequence. This, to some trifling extent, no doubt, may be justly feared, whilst human nature is human nature; but that any other staff can be so far above suspicion, from being so little actuated by worldly motives, few will have the hardihood to assert."
"If we wanted an example to bear us out in our assertion, let us look back to the period"
"O  when we were afflicted with the cholera, and who, we would ask, have been seen ministering to a// the wants of the dying or performing the sad offices due to the dead, when deserted by professed friends and blood relations? We answer, the clergy of every denomination. Yes, they forgot they were men, and remembered they were mi- nisters, destined by Providence to be the legitimate protectors of their fellow-men. They forgot their hitherto sectarian differences, remembering that, to be saved they should "" love one another.”"
"It may be said, and with some truth, that we have permitted our feelings to carry us away from the subject alluded to on setting out. Yes, our feelings are strong and sensitive on every subject connected with our awful condition. We feel ourselves placed under a heavy responsibility—first, as regards the public; secondly, as regards our character; for the nature of our professional avocations, imposes on us a duty, as regards the potato and its substitute, the weight of which few can feel."
"We hope for the indulgence of our kind friends for another week, which, we trust, will be yet time enough to enter fully on the discussion of the subject under consideration, and we entreat our practical friends to give us the benefit of their experience, as we shall give them ours, unpolished and unsophisticated."
"THE POTATO DISEASE Farmers Gazette, August 29'"", 1846, page 284"
"We foresee an inundation of theories as to the cause of the potato disease, which every one finds himself capable of explaining, except those who have most in- formation about it. We may therefore save the time of our readers and correspondents, as well as our own, if we take this early opportunity of expressing our intention of not giving insertion to any speculations upon the subject, unless they involve new matter, and are supported by authenticated evidence."
The following causes for the disease have already been suggested:—
The bad season of 1845.
Attacks of parasitical fungi.
"Insects, worms (the idlest of all speculations)."
Frost.’
Lightning.
Exhausted vitality.
"Bad cultivation. Guano and other manures; Miasmata, such as produce cholera in man, and murrain in cattle. The last explaining an unknown cause by an unknown agency, whose mode of action in the first instance is beyond human perception, may be taken as the last and best refuge of theorists, for it is alike incapable of proof or disproof."
OONANRWNS
"Of the remainder we shall only say that they appear to us to be all untenable. Even the season of 1845, which seemed to us and so many others peculiarly"
"330  suited to bring on the affection, we long ago disclaimed as a true cause; for irresistible evidence to the contrary accumulated during the winter. In fact no theory of the potato disease will satisfy the conditions of the problem, unless it explains the following unquestionable facts:—"
1.lt has for some years past been violent in St.Helena.
"2. It appeared in the year 1845 at Genoa and Lisbon, and at Grahamstown in the cape colony, exclusively in potato crops obtained from English seed, and therefore of the growth of 1844."
"3.It appeared in 1845 in the Bermudas, in fields cropped with potatoes obtained from the United States, and not in those which had been cropped with Bermuda sets."
"4.lt has broken out in New Holland, upon the authority of Dr. Francis Campbell, in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald, dated March 18, 1846."
"°§.1t was little known in bog or moss-land in 1845, and now it has broken out there with as much violence as elsewhere."
6.It is accompanied by an increased excitability of the potatoes both young and old.
"7- It invariably begins as a brown decay of the bark of the potato-stem, under ground, and an inch or two above its origin from the old set. To this we have never yet found an exception: all the blotching and bearing of leaves are long posterior to this."
"8. It has broken out at this moment (Aug. 12, 1846) in crops obtained on well"
"drained unmanured land from sets imported from Naples, the Azores, Oporto, and New Grenada, every one of which places was reported to be uninfected—"

"COPY OF A TREASURY MINUTE Farmers Gazette, September 5"" 1846, pages 294-295"
"My Lords have before them the Act 10 Vic., cap. 107, "" To facilitate the employment of the labouring poor for a limited period in distressed districts in lre- land,"" and proceed to consider the revised instructions which the provisions of this act and the experience which has been acquired from the operations for the relief of the people suffering from the failure of the potato crop in Ireland since the month of November last render it desirable should be issued to the Board of Works, and to Comissary-General Sir R. Routh, who is in charge of the duties lately executed by the relief commission."
"No authority can, from the present date, be given for the execution of any new works under the 9th Viet, cap.; and such works as may hereafter be requied for the relief of distress must be presented and sanctioned according to the provisions of the 10th Victoria, cap. 107."
"The Board of Works were instructed by the Treasury minute dated 21st ultimo, to"
"bring to an early close all the works under the 9th Viet., cap. 1, which were not required for the relief of urgent distress; and the board were informed that if the"
"QO  parties interested desired that works so discontinued should afterwards be recommenced and completed, it was open to them to take the usual steps to provide for that object, either by obtaining loans secured by grand jury presentment, or by other means."
"Their lordships desire that the Board of Works will report to what extent works have been discontinued under these instructions on the ground of their not being really required for the purpose of giving relief, and that it may be understood, in accordance with the passage above adverted to in the minute of the 21st July, that if it should become necessary to recommence any such works, the renewal of them must be provided for either in the manner above referred to or under the 10th Viet, cap. 107."
"With a view to give every practicable assistance to the presentment sessions, the Board of Works should be prepared with plans and estimates of those works in each district in which relief is likely to be required, on which the destitute poor might, with the greatest public advantage, be employed; and an officer of the board should be in attendance at the sessions to furnish every explanation that may be called for."
"In order to prevent labourers from being induced to leave their proper employments, and to congregate on the Relief Works, in the hope of getting regularly paid money wages in return for a smaller quantum of work than they have been accustomed to give, the following rules ought, in their lordships' opinion, to be strictly observed:—"
"No person should be employed on any relief works who can obtain employment on other public works, or in farming or other private operations in the neighbourhood."
"The wages given to persons employed on relief works should, in every case, be, at least, 2d. a day less than the average rate of wages in the district. And the persons employed on the relief works should, to the utmost possible extent, be paid in proportion to the work actually done by them. Their lordships suggest for the consideration of the Lord Lieutenant, that it may be advisable that in every case in which it may be determined to assemble extraordinary sessions for the presentment of works under the 10th Viet., cap. 107, instructions should also be issued to the lieutenant of the county, to re-assemble the relief committees of the districts in which such works are proposed to be carried on, making such changes in the individuals composing the committees as circumstances may require; or, if no relief committees have yet been organised in the districts in question, to appoint new committees in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Relief Commission."
"Their lordships also suggest that, in order to obviate inconveniences which have been experienced during the late relief operations, the following alterations should be made in the instructions under which the local relief committees have hitherto acted:— First, with regard to the assistance given by the relief committees in the proper appropriation of the relief provided under the 10th Vic., cap. 107, by means of public works.—"
That tickets should not hereafter be issued by the relief committees entitling
"332  persons to employment on such public works. That, instead thereof the relief committees should furnish (according to a form to be supplied to them for that purpose) the officers in charge of the works on the part of the Board of Works, with lists of persons requiring relief, noting them in the order in which they are considered to be entitled to priority, either on account of their large families or from any other cause; that the committees should revise these lists from time to time, as occasion may require; and that the officers of the Board of Works, acting on the information contained in these lists, or acquired by them from other sources, should themselves furnish tickets entitling persons to employment on the relief works for certain limited periods, according to the circumstances of each case."
"Secondly, as regards the functions performed by the relief committee, independently of the relief works carried on under the provisions of acts of parliament:— Their lordships consider that donations in aid of private subscriptions may be made, when necessary, as heretofore, from public funds placed for that purpose at the disposal of the Lord Lieutenant; and that these donations may continue to be as a general rule, in the proportion of from one-third to one-half of the amount of the private subscriptions, according to the extent of the destitution and the means of the subscribers."
"’ But their lordships are of opinion that, in consideration of the assistance so to be given from the public purse, the proceedings of the relief committees in the appropriation of the funds administered by them, should be subjected to any degree of control on the part of the government that ""may be considered desirable; for which purpose their accounts and correspondence should at all times be for the inspection of government officers appointed for the purpose.. and any further explanations that may be required on any particular point should be immediately famished."
"In order to keep in check, as far as possible, the social evils incident to an extensive system of relief, it is indispensably necessary that the relief committees should sell the meal or other food provided by them, except in small quantities, to persons who are known to have no other means of procuring food; that the price at which the meal is sold should, as nearly as possible, be the same as the market prices which prevail in the neighbourhood; that the committees should not give a higher rate of wages, nor exact a smaller quantum of work, in any works carried on by them from funds at their own disposal, than is the case in respect to the works carried on under the superintendence of the Board of Works, and that works should be carried on by them only to the extent to which private employment is proved not to be available."
"The serious attention of every person who will have to take part in the measures of relief rendered necessary by the new and more complete failure of the potato crop should be particularly called to this important fact, that the limitations and precautions which have been prescribed to the government boards and officers in carrying out the relief operations, with the object of rendering the necessary interference with the labour and provision markets productive of the smallest possible disturbance of the ordinary course"
"O  of trade and industry, will be rendered negatory if the same prudence and reserve are not practised by the relief committees in the administration of the funds placed at their disposal by private or public benevolence; and their lordships therefore feel it to be their duty earnestly to request that every person concerned will, to the extent of the influence possessed by him, endeavour to secure such a restriction of the measures of relief to cases of real destitution, and such a just consideration for the interest of merchants and dealers in the free exercise of whose callings the public welfare is so deeply concerned, that instead of the habitual dependence upon charitable aid which might otherwise be apprehended from the extensive measures of relief in progress, every description of trade and industry may be stimulated by them, and the bonds of society may become more firmly knit by the benevolent and intelligent co-operation of the different orders and ranks of which it is composed to avert a common calamity, and to prepare for recommencing the ordinary occupations of social life with advantages which are at present only perfectly enjoyed in some parts of Ireland."
"The limited grant fund provided by the 10th Vict., cap. 109, entitled "" An Act to authorise a further issue of saoacy in aid Public Works of acknowledged utility in poor districts in Ireland,” is, according to the terms ! act, applicable only to the case of unimproved :ts, like parts of the counties of Kerry, Galway, Mayo, and Donegal, where, although road and other works would be productive of more than usual al public advantage the districts are too poor to bear the expense of them and the act therefore direct that in cases in which die repayment of the loan to the amount of at least a moiety of the estimated expense of such work shall have been secured, and such further contributions shall have been made as the Commissioners of her Majesty's Treasury shall think fit to require from the individuals principally interested in the projected works such aid shall be afforded from this fund, in the shape of grants, as the occasion may appear to require."
"The applications which may be received for grants under this act will have to be carefully examined and inquired into by the Commissioners of Public Works, who will recommend for sanction those works which appear to them to combine the greatest permanent utility with the relief of urgent distress, taking care that the proprietors specially interested are required to contribute, in addition to their share of the general assessment for the repayment of half the expense of the works, sums proportioned, in some degree, to the special benefits they will derive from them."
"My lords have considered with the careful attention which the importance of the subject demands, the measures proper to be taken with a view to continue the late Commissariat operations to the extent which may be absolutely necessary for the purpose of providing supplies of food for sale in districts to which the ordinary operations of the provision trade cannot be expected to extend, the strictest regard being at the same time paid to the pledge which has been given, not to interfere in any case in which there is a reasonable expectation that the market will be supplied by mercantile enterprise; and they will proceed to state the course which appears to them to be the best adapted to secure to important object in view."
Their lordships have already given directions that no portion of the stock of meal
334  remaining in store in the different depots should be sold merely for the sake of disposing of it.
"It has been fully established by the experience of the late operations, that the ports on the northern, eastern, and southern coasts, from Londonderry to Cork, and"
"_ those parts of the interior which are ordinarily supplied from them, may safely be left to the foresight and enterprise of private merchants; and it will only be necessary for the government, so far as this part of Ireland is concerned, to take effectual precautions that the supplies introduced by private traders from abroad are properly protected, both while they are in transit and when they are stored for future consumption; and for this purpose their lordships rely upon the Lord Liéutenant making every necessary arrangement, in communication with the Commander of the Forces in Ireland, and the Inspector-General of the constabulary force."
"Acting on this principle, their lordships have directed that the supplies of food now in store should be concentrated without delay at the following depots :—"
"In the interior—Longford, Banagher. On the coast—Limerick, Galway, Westport, Siigo."
"And Commissary-General Hewetson has been instructed to take immediate steps for the transfer of the quantity remaining in store in the depot at Cork to Limerick, in the charge of which depot he will relieve Commissary-General Coffin, who will remain on full pay with a view to his being employed hereafter, as the occasion may require."
"Subordinate depots will be established, under the charge of the constabulary, at other places on the western coast, as the necessity for taking such a step may become apparent. ."
"Their lordships desire that it may be fully understood that even at those places at which government depots will be established for the sale of food, the depots will not be opened while food can be obtained by the people from private dealers at reasonable prices;-and that, even when the depots are opened, the meal will, if possible, be sold at such prices as will allow of the private trader selling at the same price with a reasonable profit."
"The Relief Commission ceased on the 10th instant, since which period Comissary- General Sir Randolph Routh, has continued to transact such business as required immediate attention; and, considering the experience which has been acquired by that officer, and his well-proved ability for the task, their lordships are of opinion that the duties confided to the Relief Commission during the late operations may, with great public advantage, be entrusted to Sir Randolph Routh, acting under the authority of the Lord Lieutenant, and in constant communication with this board."
"Their lordships have taken steps to procure the early arrival in this country, from"
"the stations where they are employed abroad, of a sufficient number of well- qualified commissiarat officers, not only to take charge of the depots which it has"
"O  been determined to retain, but also, under the orders of Sir Randolph Routh, to communicate with the Local Relief Committees, and to afford through him, to her Majesty's government, correct information as to the state of the districts in which they will be stationed."
"Measures have also been taken for strengthening the I Board of Works, to enable it to meet the coming emergency, on which subject a separate communication will this day be made to the Board of Works and his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant."
"Transmit a copy of this minute to Mr. Bedington, and request that he will move the Lord Lieutenant, and that he shall concur therein, to give the necessary directions in regard to such of the arrangements as more immediately depend upon his Excellency for carrying them into effect."
"Also transmit a copy to the Commissioners of Public Works, and to Commissary- General Sir Randolph Routh, for their information and guidance."

"Farmers Gazette, September 5"", 1846, page 298"
"EVERY day that passes over us, every district we visit, every fair, market, or public place of resort that business calls us to, nay, every individual we converse with, brings fresh proofs of the dangerous precipice on which we stand, without being able to foresee to its fullest extent the calamities that await us—calamities that no concepiion can be entertained of except by such as have been through life amongst the people, and whose professional avocations render them susceptible of the impressions that misery, dire misery, unparalelled in the history of any country, that now is making such rapid strides towards us, and whose consequences will, ere long, shake to the centre the foundation of society, if proper means be not taken to avert the calamity."
"Let not the apparent calm that, to some extent, exists at the present time, be supposed to continue much longer. The labourer is still employed at the public works and still fed on the provisions so laudable afforded by the government last seasom the farmer is still occupied in securing his corn crop, his con-acre crop such as it is, affords a little sustenance, and, in some measure, assists the labourer to support his family; but let a few weeks elapse, the government provision will be all consumed, and no likelihood of a renewed supply from that quarter—the corn holders will hold firmly closed, the doors of their granaries, by the seal of high prices — monopoly, the consequence of combination, will, as before the repeal of the corn law soon show itself. It is already at our thresholds. Let a few days but elapse, the labourers employed at the harvest work will be thrown idle; the farmer with a small holding and /arge family will have nothing to sustain existence but his half-supplied grain crop he will not, as heretofore, have his pig to meet his first half-year's rent, or to pay for the provision which he got on credit last summer. The more extensive corn-growing farmer will share the same fate; and no man of the so-called agricultural community can entertain any hope of being able to meet his liabilities, except the man who contributed least of all others to the general good—namely, the grazier, or stock-master. He will, when called on by his landlord or others to meet his liabilities, represent the general loss, the potato failure, as a reason why he should be passed over, and his representation will be attended to, for several reasons which we do not feel it necessary to enumerate. He will, whether justly or otherwise, join in the outcry against the landlords; demand the remission of arrears and the foregoing of rents. In common with the usurious money-lender, whose property cannot be reached for any national purpose, he will cry out, "" Tax the landlords: they, and they only, are the men on whom the burden should rest."" Will they bear it’! Can they bear it ? No, they cannot; and if matters proceed as present appearances indicate, a lengthened period will not elapse till the landed property of the country will change hands, and those who now occupy princely palaces will be inmates of prisons, for ""to work"
"338  they will be unable, and to beg they will be ashamed."""
"We again call on the aristocracy, before it becomes too late, to protect their properties; for, by so doing, they will protect the country from the impending ruin that hourly threatens it. Let them assemble, and for once become a united people; let them for once believe that it is by such united exertion at the present moment they can hope for success. Let them demand from the government the means by which ""life and property” can be rendered secure; for it is only by famine they ever can be endangered. Let them insist on getting the means by which the people can be fed for this year, and instructed in the manner by which they can procure food for themselves hereafter. Government will not refuse them: it cannot refuse them, if the demand be made in such a manner as not fo be misunderstood; for no government, whatever its politics may be, can remain deaf to the calls of so integral a portion of the nation, if those calls be made by.the legitimate heads. The demands or the warnings of individuals, no matter what their intelligence, or what their standing in society may be, will be unavailing. It must be general and simultaneous, to be productive of effect."
"To talk of a substitute for the potato, no matter what sum it would cost, for one year, would be no more than an atom in the air, or a drop in the ocean, if the people be not so far instructed and supplied as will enable them, for the time to come, to be independent of the potato, or of any one other species of crop, in such a country, and with such a variable climate as this is. No; they must be taught the value, use, and cultivation of other crops; their lands must be prepared to receive them; and they must be supplied with the proper seeds, and taught the use of husbanding and the application of manures. Otherwise, this year of famine is but a precursor to those hereafter to follow in rapid and unbroken succession. The people in their present state of information, no matter how good their intentions may be, cannot avert it, and rarely was the question— ""How can I, unless you show me?""—more appropriately put than it will be put during the forthcoming year by each tenant farmer to his landlord, patron, or friend, when advised to grow other vegetables to substitute the potato."
"It is presumed, it must be believed, that, in addition to a government staff, local directors, trustees, or managers, must be had in each district. We have already suggested the clergy of every denomination in each parish; but as some of the parishes in Ireland are very large, it will be necessary that more than one depot of relief should be had in each of such parishes; and there is no parish, however poor, that does not contain a sufficient number of respectable men to take the management of such second depot, under the guidance of the clergy, and assisted by the police—of course, in all cases subject to the inspection and check of a government officer."
"As there can be no question of obtaining a sufficiency of productive employment for ‘the labourer who has no land, or but a mere little garden, his condition is considered comparatively safe, so long as employment is given him, and food of any kind, whether native or exotic, is to be had. And now we come more fully to the working farmers of every class, whose condition, as we have more than once said, is that which should be toe more narrowly watched. In the majority of cases, the land occupied by such farmers has not been producing more than one-half what it is"
"O  capable of producing of corn, if better managed. Many of the newspapers, local and metropolitan, at the present time, are recommending a more extensive growth of corn as a substitute for the potato; and from statistical data shown by them, it appears, if they are right, that double or treble the quantity of land must be under cultivation, to produce a sufficient amount of food for the country."
"This is a mistake which no practical agriculturist, at least would fall into. There is plenty of land under cultivation at present in Ireland to produce abundance of better food than ever the poor Irish have been accustomed to use, and a greater supply for export than ever yet had been shipped from Ireland, if the same land would be but properly cultivated and judiciously cropped, and all that is required in the present instance is, to supply the capital and the necessary instruction to the people. The capital must be supplied by the government, and on such conditions as can be accepted by the lauded proprietors without danger or risk. It is with themselves to see how that can be accomplished, and it is with us to show them how they can easily obtain the necessary instruction for their people in the present dearth of information, in most places, with few exceptions."
"We now address ourselves to the landlords great and small, and in the advice we are going to offer we stake our professional character, which is to us as much as an estate is to a landed proprietor. Let every landlord, who can afford it, employ a gardener or a number of gardeners proportionate to his means, property, and the condition of his tenantry as to large or small farms; let every Poor Law Union in Ireland be supplied with a gardener or two; let every parish, in which there is not a workhouse situated, be supplied with a suitable number of the same class, and let the business of these men be to teach the poorer farmers how to cultivate their land properly, and also the use and application of such crops, as each will know, can be had in abundance to substitute the potato. Let the proper seeds be had at first cost, which, from the few varieties of common things necessary, will not be very expensive. Let government be pressed to remit, if not totally repeal, any duty that the present law imposes on foreign seeds."
"Our suggestion will to some appear a novel if not a futile one. The potato extinction in Ireland is a novelty, but hunger is not; a good substitute for the potato is a novelty, and, in an abundant supply, the novelty will be still greater, but not the less acceptable."
"We fancy we hear the objections of a few antiquated individuals, the advocates of large farms and complicated and expensive machinery, against this suggestion. These objections we can listen to with becoming attention, first reminding the objectors of a few facts which all can satisfy themselves on the correctness of. First, farming is but gardening on a larger but less profitable scale, and secondly, the best managed farms in Ireland, at the present time, are managed by men who are practical and scientific gardeners, whose great success is owing, first, to the systematic habits acquired in learning their profession—secondly, to their knowledge of vegetable physiology—thirdly, to their knowledge of the nature of soils and the best practical modes of improving them by draining and deepening, and finally to their improved reasoning powers on cause and effect. We will now give a few names, and let those who will, challenge comparison—first, Mr. Kelly, of Portrane, was bred a gardener, so was Mr. M'Cormick, at Lord Charlemont's; Mr. Gibson at"
"340  Straffon, in the county Kildare; Mr. Hendrick, at Mr. Moore OFarrell's ; Mr. Sinnott, at Ballyhightand, in the county Wexford; Mr. Archbold, at Kilcornan, in the county Galway; Mr. Alexander, at the Heath farm, near Athy; Mr. Toner, at Carton; Mr. Lawler, at Mr. Guinness's, at Beaumount; Mr. Waddle, at Sir Robert Shaws, Mr. Molloy, Stradbally Hall, Queen's County; and hundreds of others whom we could name, and with whose names the public are familiar. To what does Mr. Skirling owe his celebrity as an agriculturist ? and to what do his many pupils, now doing $0 much credit to him and themselves throughout the country ? Simply to this alone, that the model farm is cultivated like a garden. Let it not be said we have instituted this comparison to lessen the great value that is, and should be set on the many most respectable men throughout the country who have, not been educated as gardeners, but who are, nevertheless, in every manner qualified for their arduous duties; no, our object is to show the country that an efficient staff can be had in every manner qualified to teach the people how to provide a suitable substitute, or set of substitutes, for the potato. We shall return to this subject again, and, in the meantime, shall be much obliged for suggestions to assist us in showing how salutary checks. can be instituted; first, as to character and qualifications, secondly, as to the mode of procedure to be observed in the event of our suggestions being adopted and modified ; and, thirdly, as to the best mode of communicating to each, the combined intelligence of all, maturely considered, suitably .condensed, and satisfactorily, proved."
DISEASE OF THE POTATO
"Farmers Gazette, September 5'"", 1846, page 299"
"siR—The disease of the potato, so much to be regretted, is now too well known to admit of any hope of renovation by any of the former methods of cultivation; and if it be thought prudent ever to try them as a main crop again, I consider it behoves every man to exert his skill to try by every means in his power, to preserve at least as much for seed as not to lose them altogether. I am therefore induced to submit the following plan, if you consider it worth a place in your truly valuable paper:—"
"I have been for a good many years acquainted with the greening or sun-burning of the potatoes that I intended for early seed; a practice which may infallibly be relied upon as a sure preventative against any failure in their vegetation, however immature when first exposed to the action of the weather. As far as I can see or learn this season, immaturity in the crop is everywhere to be met with, even in the earliest planted portions. From my long experience in the above for early planting, I am now induced to try it more extensively; and I am at present taking the mould away with turnip-hoes; of course there may be quicker methods by means of the plough. This plan I am adopting previous to exposing them altogether. I think they may be dug out early this month."
"The practicability of this method may be questioned by many; however, as the malady is fast progressing, and public attention in a great measure turned from the hope of success in their future cultivation, it would be advisable for every man who wishes to preserve seed for the ensuing year, to try a portion of his crop in the"
"O  above way; the labour is not much, and the experiment ""*could be worth a trial, I bars often found in the greening of potatoes that a light frost had no bad effect on them; however, care might be taken until they are partly greened—"
"Yours, &C., EDWARD MOLLOY, Stradbally Hall, September 1, 1846."
EMPLOYMENT FOR THE POOR TO LORD JOHN RUSSELL
"Farmers Gazette, September 12°"", 1846, page 315"
"My LoRD—I am induced a third time to draw your attention to the dreadful crisis which is more than impending over this country, and endeavour to show that measures of a much more comprehensive and extended nature than appear to have entered into the contemplation of the present government must be resorted to, if it is intended to rescue this country from famine and desolation."
"I calculate that five out of the eight millions composing the population had their food or living by the potato, the remaining three millions being partly feed upon them, and the immense supply of pigs altogether, besides the aid afforded to support cows, horses, and poultry. Five millions of people, at the average of six to each family, will produce 833,333 families, which, as the rate of one acre of potatoes to each, and valuing fifth acre even at the low rate of £15 per acre, the loss to Ireland will be £12.000,000. I compute that half the 5,000,000, or 416.666 families, will require relief at the rate, at least, of 6lb. of meal per day to each family (averaging young and old), which, in twelve months, would amount to 407,355 tons, and at the rate of £10 per ton would cost £4,073,650."
"Now, my lord, I hope it may not be deemed too great a presumption in an individual to ask, is the present government prepared for such a call ? and are they satisfied that in trusting to private enterprise, such a supply at food will be available, as it would be most desirable at the present moment if public confidence were so established as to hold out reasonable hope that sufficient employment and food on the cheapest terms would be afforded. If we live under that constitution, the spirit of which is ""that no man shall starve while the state can afford the means of procuring subsistence,"" it cannot at least be deemed unreasonable the calling your lordship's attention to the subject, as it would appear that neither the executive nor the parliament are aware to the full extent of the loss of the potato crop to Ireland, and I am sorry to be obliged to add, that the oats and barley crops are so deficient, that time should not be lost in stopping the distillation from corn."
"The sum or food necessary to be diffused amongst those 416,666 families, through the channel of employment, cannot be afforded in sufficient time or quantity through the medium of what are generally deemed public works; however useful they may be as auxiliaries. Employment then not as an auxiliary, but itself the principal, must be sought out. Where is it to be found ? Again, a third time I answer—only in the improvement of the soil by thorough-draining, and deepening it, with other permanent improvements."
"342  To meet the present exigency those 416,666 families would by draining one acre and a half Irish, at the average cost of £5 per acre, earn £7 Is each during the winter, when they could not be systematically employed otherwise. Where draining is not required, subsoiling or other public works might be substituted. This expenditure would as nearly as possible amount to £3,000,000 of the sum required for relief, and X 1,073.650 will remain for other public works. But it should be remembered, that by those additional works, now are adding to the many burdens already upon the land; in justice, then, those lands should be improved to enable them to meet this increased taxation, and the increased value will afford additional security."
"To this extent, then, the government should come. forward if they intend anything effectual. It will be necessary, too, that they should interfere before it is too late, and act energetically and practically. By adopting such a course, the ability would be afforded to the country to repay the outlay; and surely there is no description of employment which will afford equal security. Let a vital benefit then be conferred upon the people, and a lasting benefit upon the country."
"I have the honour to remain, your lordship's very obedient and very humble"
"servant,"

FAILURE OF THE POTATO CROP
"Farmers Gazette, September 12°"", 1846, pages 329-330"
"sIR—The crop of potatoes being now by almost universal consent all but gone, what remains being scarcely, if at all, worth the trouble and expense of being cleared from the ground, it becomes the public carefully to consider and estimate the extent of the calamity, and, if possible, to devise the means of mitigation, and the substitute for the usual sustenance of the people almost entirely, and in a great measure, fed on this esculent; that a fair estimate of the amount of food lost and of the substitute to be supplied is the object of these lines; that the foundation of the following estimates may be more clearly established and completely understood, it may be proper to premise that the extent of Ireland, according to the ordinance survey, is 32,512 square statute miles, from which are to be deducted 711 square miles under water leaving, at 640 statute acres to the mile, 20,352,640 statute acres or what will better suit our purpose, 12,707,497 acres of the late Irish plantation measure as the nearest estimate of the extent o/ Ireland."
"The population of Ireland, at the census of 1831, was 7,767,401, and at that of 1841 was 8,175,124, being an increase in the period of ten years of 407,723, or about 5 per cent, for that period; the population in 1846 estimated from these data, will be found to be 8,389,687, being an increase in the five years of 214,563. The population of the borough towns, in 1841, was 701,869, which, at a similar rate of increase, may be estimated in this year (1846) at 720,290, being an increase in"
"©  the five years of 18,421. The population, therefore, of Ireland thus stands—"
"Rural population 7,669,397 Borough population 720.290"
"Total population of Ireland 8,389,687"
"Of this vast number, potatoes have hitherto been an article of food—some using more, some less, and a very great proportion of the people being entirely subsisted thereon; indeed, there cannot exist a doubt that one-half, or even a greater proportion, subsist solely on potatoes; and since in the greater number of the work- houses, in the several poor law unions, 3 Ibs. of potatoes are, or lately have been, the usual allowance for the dinner for each adult pauper (male or female), and be it remarked, not kept to hard labour. Ten Ibs. may be fairly estimated as rather an under daily allowance for such half of the population; however, as the object hereof is not to overrate, but the contrary, it may be taken for granted that one- third the rural population consume daily that quantity (10 Ibs.), that another third consume daily 6 Ibs., and the remaining third 2 Ibs. If this be a true estimate, 6 Ibs. will be the average daily consumption of the entire rural population. In the borough towns the people use other food than potatoes, yet the consumption of this species of food is considerable, and that the average daily consumption of each individual is 2 Ibs., can scarcely admit of doubt; but be this as it may, in order that every person may exercise an individual opinion, the consumption of the rural and town population has been calculated at the rate of 1 Ib. daily for each individual, at which rate the rural population require daily 22,825 barrels of 24 stones each, the town population 2,144 barrels; the yearly consumption at the same rate is, of the former, 8,331,339 barrels, of the latter 782,443 barrels. In addition to these quantities the consumption for seed, feeding cattle, swine, horses, &e., is also great. One-fourth the consumption of the rural population is much under the quantity actually applied for these uses. Persons holding large farms used more without than within their houses, while very small holders did not thus use so large a proportion, but as over-estimate is not the object, let it be taken as before stated. If it suit not the opinions of any persons reading these lines, as the calculations are made for single pounds, by a little trouble they may be so modified as to suit individual opinions. Allowing then 6 Ibs, as the average daily consumption of the rural population, and 2 Ibs. as the same of the town population, and one- fourth of the rural consumption for seed, cattle, swine, &c., the account will thus stand—"
"Barrels. Rural population, at 6 Ibs. daily average 49,988,034 One-fourth for seed, cattle, swine, See. 12,497,008 Town population, at 2 Ibs. daily average 1,564,886 64,049,928"
"Thus it appears that, for human consumption, in Ireland 51,552,920 barrels of potatoes have been ordinarily used, and as, from an almost general concurrence, the crop this year is gone—lost for ever to the poorest people in Europe, in a country where no substitute whatever exists for their sustenance—amounting in the gross to 64,049,928 barrels; and, at 5s. by the barrel, 2d. by the stone, of the value of £16,012,482, three millions and upwards above the estimated rental of"
"344  Ireland, at 70 barrels to the Irish acre (certainly above the average produce), requiring for growth 914,999 such acres or more than the one-fourteenth part of all Ireland, exclusive of the part under water. Great as is this, it is not the sole loss arising from the failure of the potato crop; for there must be added thereto that dependent on the production of bacon, pork, butter, and even beef, for of the last potatoes ordinarily furnished a considerable supply; add, also, the excess of expenditure for procuring other and different kinds of provisions for the sustenance of the people; so that most probably this loss will altogether amount to the enormous sum of thirty millions and upwards."
"What may be the substitute for potatoes, is the next object of inquiry, and a"
"matter of serious inquiry, indeed, if a substitute be found, how it can be."
"procured by a people rendered by this severe visitation, in every sense of the word, bankrupt; the capital of a great majority of whom consisted solely of the potato garden."
"Suppose corn, say oats, the proposed substitute. Let us estimate on the same principles how much may be necessary:—It has been asserted, I believe on government authority, and there is little reason to doubt it, that 7 Ibs. of Indian meal will support a person for a week. There are many who cannot"
consume so much. Let us suppose oatmeal to have an equally nutritious —
"quality and let the weekly consumption by each individual of the proposed substitute be estimated. Every individual in one-fourth of the entire population may well be supposed to require 7 Ibs. for the week a second fourth to require 6 Ibs., a third fourth 4 Ibs., and the remaining fourth 3 Ibs. The average of these quantities is 5 Ibs; but, be this quantity too large or too small, as the following calculation has been made for 1 Ib., the imputed error of the estimate can be readily corrected; being made on the bases of population, 8,389,687, the account will stand thus—"
"Supply for 1 week 1 Ib. per week 74,908 Cwt Supply for a period of 4 weeks 299.632 Cwt Supply for a period of 52 weeks —_.3,895,212 Cwt"
"Any of these quantities multiplied by five, the average we have assumed, or by any other number more suiting the opinion of the inquirer, will give the estimated consumption for the period of time opposite that number. The last of the numbers multiplied by five, our average will give the supply required for the year, 19,476,060 cwt. of meal. It is an over estimate that one barrel of oats at 14 stone to the barrel, yields one hundred weight of meal; but let us grant that it does yield that weight, then the 19,476,060 cwt. of meal may stand for the same number of barrels of oats, which at 16 barrels to the Irish acre, rather over the average, will require for growth 1,217,254 late Irish acres, between one-eleventh and one-tenth of all Ireland, exclusive of the part under water at 10s. per barrel, of the value'of £9,738,030. It ought however, to be borne in mind, that 15s. (oats bears that price now) or even 20s. will be nearer to the selling price of oats than 10s. used in this estimate."
"From what has been already set forth, it appears that the large quantity of nearly 20,000,000 cwt. of meal, or rather of various articles of subsistence equivalent"
"O  thereto, is necessary to supply the loss of the potato crop. Access to the parliamentary returns of the quantities of the several kinds of grain usually exported from Ireland is not convenient, and therefore conjecture alone can be hazarded, that this quantity at a very moderate price, equal in value to the whole rental of Ireland, or at all events nearly equal, will be found to bear-a large proportion, or perhaps exceed the actual exports in other and more prosperous years. Various means of providing food in lieu of the lost potato crop, shall be the subject of another communication."

SUGGESTIONS TO IRISH LANDLORDS
"Farmers Gazette, September 12"", 1846, pages 330-331"
"sIR—In a letter to Mr. Blacker, which, at his request, I allowed him to publish, I expressed a hope to be able, about this time, to bring the subject of providing suitable habitations for the poor, with allotments, before the public. I have given the subject much consideration, and I think, that any landlord desirous of improving his property, cannot be at a loss how to proceed, if he attentively reads over Mr. Slacker's prize essay, and Mr. Butler's, Mr. Prentice's, and Martin Doyle's essays on the amelioration of the condition of the Irish la-I bourer; but as these essays may not be within the reach of all, and may be considered by some too long to read, I would, through the medium of your widely-circulated Journal, very briefly endeavour to place before the landlords of Ireland a few plans or suggestions which, if carried out, would not only tend to develope the resources of the country, increase its produce, alter its appearance, but, to a great extent, meet the present trying emergency, in which al! are placed, and here I would request the most serious and attentive consideration of the landlords to the fact, that an act has just been passed, and I may say is already extensively about to be brought into operation, by which the land of the country may be taxed to an unlimited extent, for public works, and that one-half of the tax so to be raised must be borne by them; will they allow the scratching at hills system still to continue? or will they meet and co- operate with their tenants in making useful and permanent improvements mutually beneficial to both, and tending to develope the resources of the country. One or other alternative must be adopted—the people cannot starve, they must get immediate employment or they are in danger. The pians that I would suggest are—"
1. Drainage.
2. The improvement of the habitations of the poor.
3. The making the undertenants hold direct from the head landlord.
Ail these plans can be carried out without legislative enactments; mutual co- operation between landlord and tenant can effect them.
With regard to the first subject—Drainage—Landlords will gladly expend
"346  capital in purchasing property if they can obtain four per cent interest on their outlay. Drainage carried out judiciously, either at the sole expense of the landlord when he can command the capital and make his own arrangements with his tenants, will readily produce five per cent, or by the mutual co-ope- ration of both landlord and tenant will improve the land so drained fully ten per cent, while it increases the food of the country and renders it more healthful. Let, then, every landlord make out, or direct his agent to make out a return showing the quantity of land on each townlaud on his estate requiring to be drained, and ascertain what co-operation may be obtained from his tenants,"
according to their tenure and the beneficial interests they have in their
holdings.
"With regard to the second subject; the cotti er or labourer is at present, generally speaking, placed in a habitation unfit for a human being, and in which some would hesitate to house their pigs. To take the very utmost expense that may be incurred in building or repairing houses for these cottiers, you need not calculate on an expenditure of more than £20 for each; five per cent, on this outlay will give a rent of 20s. and I do not at all exaggerate when I assert, that for a comfortable house and half an acre of ground, the cottier or labourer will cheerfully pay £2 a-year. On this subject, I should say the rule should be, a comfortable house, on building or repairing which the landlord should have five per cent, on his outlay, and a fair rent for whatever portion of land might be given as an allotment with each house; let then the landlord ascertain the number of cottiers or labourers requiring habitations fit for human beings on each townland on his property. When he can himself command the capital, let him carry out the suggestions I have offered ; where he has not himself the capital, the government ought to assist him by a loan, which might be secured by a first charge on his property."
"With regard to the third, and by far the most difficult subject, the making the under- tenants direct tenants to the head landlord; but the importance of the subject cannot be over-rated. Generally speaking, the under tenant is most miserably housed, and pays, or rather I should say is charged (but in his miserable state by every means avoiding to- pay) from 20 to 30 per cent, more than the direct tenant is paying his landlord. We need not expect any good result, however able we may be to do so, if, we endeavour to benefit any class by doing an injustice to another; and, therefore, wherever the middleman has been receiving from 20 to 30 per cent, over the rent he pays, either by his contract or by the negligence of the landlord or agent, for some length of time, I would give him, on a surrender of his under-tenants, fair and reasonable compensation. I am not preaching what I have not (with the sanction of my employers) practised. I think I cannot better illus- trate both, what I mean as to the plan to be adopted for getting up the under- tenants and giving the middleman compensation, than by giving, in very brief detail, a plan which I have myself carried out."
"A farm of about 400 acres was set at £400 a-year, and relet to the under-tenants at £650 a-year. A bad year came—the under-tenants were unable to meet the middleman with their rents—he wanted an abatement which I would not hear of, but I agreed to take a surrender of his lease, which he consented to on an annuity being given, by which he apparently lost £100 a-ycar; but, in reality, got as much without any trouble aa, one year with the other, he was able to collect, with the"
"io  application of the screw. I reduced the under-tenants rents from 15 to 20 per cent.; they got their land at a rent they could pay, and the landlord was very nearly borne harmless in the transaction, the encreased rent fo him, very nearly making up the annuity. I am sure there would neither be an injustice done to the middleman, nor could he reasonably complain, if a rule-was laid down that his under-tenants should be taken up from him, that they should be given their holdings at a fair rent, and that whatever this fair rent made over the rent he paid to his landlord should be secured to him during the residue of his term. Thus, if A. B. middleman paid C. D. the head landlord £300 a-year for a farm, and received, or was promised £500 a-year from the under-tenants, if the fair rent for these under- tenants to pay was £400 a-year, I would take them up and set them their holdings at such a rent aa would make up £400 a-year, and I would give to the middleman an annuity of £100 a year ; and surely it would be better for him to get this sum without trouble or expense, than to be promised £200 and not realise, after the severest application of the screw, £120. Let, then, every landlord make out a return showing all the under-tenants on his estate the present rent they pay, and the present value of their holdings, and it will be for the interest of the middlemen to co-operate with him in carrying out the arrangements I have proposed."
"In conclusion, I would venture to ask one simple question, would not the draining of wet and waste lands, and the improvement of the habitations of the poor, afford a better field for employment, than the system of public works which have for the last few months been carried on embracing very generally the lowering of hills, (and leaving the roads impassable) at a very heavy tax; for though the government gave half the cost, in reality the landholder is not benefitted. (I am sure the state is not much the better for the expenditure,) as the public works which have come under my notice, have, generally speaking, cost double what they could have been executed for by grand jury presentment. An allwise and all merciful Providence, has sent us a grievous visitation. The landlords of Ireland, the much aspersed and calumniated landlords, may turn this visitation to good account, they may show that they feel the responsibility of their position, and put to silence the evil report of those who, professing a sympathy for the people, really wish they were much worse than they describe them to be, in order that they might carry out their wild and mischievous objects. I have no fears for the result; if the landlords will act as becometh them, the government will assist them. An approving conscience with a trust in an all-wise and all-just Providence, will carry them through their difficulties, and the present visitation may be made the means of raising our unhappy but beloved country from its degraded position; that this may be the result; that the resources of the country may be developed ; the condition of the poor substantially ameliorated, and the happiness and prosperity of the entire community advanced, is the sincere wish and earnest prayer of—"

"348  ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF IRELAND Farmers Gazette, October 3"", 1846, pages 355"
"At a special meeting of the council, held September 24th, Wm. Blaney, Esq., in the chair—there were also present—Sir Richard O'Donnell, Bart. ; Sir David Roche, Bart.; Hon. Charles Clements, Robert Bowen, Richard Rollow Haughton, George Macartney, T. K. Hardy, G. A. Hamilton, M. P.; Fitzherbart Filgate, G. H. Lindsay, William Monsell, W.

Sproule, Esqrs."
"The Council, having decided a second time that the question should be entertained, principally on the ground of the urgency of the present moment, and as intended for the employment and prosperity of the labouring population, Mr. Monsell read the following memorial, embodying the resolutions, to the Lord Lieutenant;— :"
"To his Excellency the Earl of Bessborough, Lord Lieutenant-General and General Governor of Ireland."
"The memorial of the committee and members of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland. Showeth—that your memorialists are deeply impressed with the danger of the present crisis, and with the insufficiency of the existing laws to meet the difficulties of their position."
"That it is the clear and imperative duty of the possessors of property in Ireland to avert from their poor fellow countrymen the miseries of famine, and that they therefore willingly and heartily acquiesce in their imposition upon them of any amount of taxation necessary for that purpose."
"That a very large sum must be raised on the security of Irish property, and expended upon labour, during the continuance of the distress occasioned by the failure of the potato crop this year."
"That the expenditure of this sum upon unproductive works will increase the disproportion already existing between labourer and capital in this country, which they look on as the main cause of want of employment of the people, and the miserable wages they are sustained by."
"That from their experience, as the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of reland, they are confident that every part of this kingdom affords the opportunity of at once employing the rural population on the improvement of the soil, and. of returning to the ratepayers a large interest for the capital expended, and thus providing an increased, quantity of food, and certain employment for the working classes in the future rears."
"O  That out of the increased value of the land arising from such productive expenditure, the ratepayers would be enabled to pay the instalments of the sum to be advanced upon the security of their land, as while with one hand money would be taken out of their pockets by taxation, with the other they would be provided with the means of repaying it."
"That for these reasons, as well as their conviction of the immoral tendency and incidental cost of public works they request your excellency at once to take into TOOT consideration the propriety of so altering the existing measure, as to secure the expenditure of the wages of labour paid for relief upon productive, instead of un- productive works, and that they humbly submit to TouT Excellency the following suggestions for the accomplishment of this object."
"As it is desirable that the sum of money to be spent for relief of the poor should be applied to reproductive labour, it is suggested that after the holding of the Presentment Sessions, in any barony or district, and after the probable sum of money required to employ the poor in such barony or district, for months be ascertained, such sums be forthwith allotted on the owners and occupiers of land, in each district, according to the Poor Law valuation."
"That such allotment be placed at the next police barrack within the district, for three days, for the information of all cesspayers who may wish to see it; and that notice of its being so placed be posted on the usual place for posting notices in the district.."
"That it shall be lawful for any person or persons representing at least three-fourths of the taxation of any townland, or number of contiguous townlands associating themselves together, to require the sum to be levied off such townland or townlands, to be spent in productive works, such as drainage or fencing, but not on the usual cultivation of the soil, and that such productive works, upon being approved of by the Board of Works, be executed by their officer; and that the wages of labourers employed on them be paid by the pay clerk of the district, under the same regulations as are now laid down for public works."
It was then agreed that a deputation consisting of the members present be requested to wait on his Excellency the next day to present the same.
"Mr. Wade having read the memorial,"
"His Excellency stated that he fully concurred in the general principle laid down in it—namely, the propriety of employing the labouring classes upon works connected with husbandry, if possible, and of a profitable and reproductive nature; but he feared that the presentments act, chap. 107 of Victoria, did not enable them to do so, as the law officers of the Crown had given it as their opinion that its operations were confined to public works alone, such as are contemplated in the Grand Jury and Presentment Acts, by which it was construed. He had, however, communicated his views on the subject, as well as those of others received from all quarters in a similar strain, to her Majesty's government; and without being enabled to promote anything specific, he hoped to have it in his power shortly to give them information on the result of the communication, which he trusted would be satisfactory. He felt"
"350  that he could not say more at present, than to thank them for the very handsome manner in which they had alluded to himself personally in the memorial, which he should make it his duty to transmit to the proper quarter."
The deputation then withdrew.

MONSELL has at length succeeded, first, in getting the council, and members of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland, to adopt the principle, which it was their bounden duty unhesitatingly to adopt, relative to the "" reproductive"" employment of the people, instead of being employed at works ruinous to the country and. demoralizing to the poor; and, secondly, in securing the influence of the executive government to carry out this great moral principle. But, as nothing has been yet done beyond securing the influence of the executive, and as the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society is not likely to take any steps politically speaking, to influence parliament to effect a change in the law for the protection of property and securing the prosperity of the country, the proprietors and occupiers of the soil must do the rest. It is true the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society has properly dealt with their fourteenth rule—a rule which some people think never should have been adopted, and which others think now is a nullity. With these opinions we have nothing to do beyond this, to state that the said rule is at present a harmless one. Indeed the combined feelings of party had rendered it so even before the establishment of Mr. Monsell's great principle; and whatever may be the fate of the measure, when brought before headquarters, the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society has so far done its duty; the Viceroy has done or /s doing his, and an eternal debt of gratitude is due to the indefatigable zeal, persevering industry, superior practical intelligence, and well-tempered conduct. of Mr. Monsell on this very important and trying occasion—a debt which neither the government nor the country should forget to discharge. But, great and valuable as the establishment of this principle is, and likely as the government, no doubt, will be to ratify it, let no one suppose it will be sufficient for the wants and present circumstances of the country. No, we repeat it is a positive good, but a negative evil; for, great as the improvements must and will be under the change about to be effected, much more is still wanting, by all classes of the people, than what is contemplated even by this change in, we will say, a well-intended but unwise law. Had the landed proprietors of Ireland the means of effecting the improvements of their lands that now must take place, and had they their lands unencumbered by mortgages or annuitants that bind them down, there is no doubt but the increased productiveness of most of these lands would, before long, not only clear off all the expenses incurred by such improvements, but also, in many cases, add cent, per cent, to the proprietor’s rent- roll, and produce a corresponding benefit to the cultivators of the soil in every grade; increase the revenue of the country by increased prosperity amongst the merchants, manufactures, traders, and artisans. But the proprietors have no such means, nor have they the means of averting the evil which this, at present, neces- sary law will inflict on them; they are crippled by pecuniary embarrassments and"
"G  bound by laws which will keep them embarrassed, if not changed by prompt and efficient legislation."
"With these laws we, as journalists, purely agricultural, have nothing to do—that is the province of the political press. Our business is the improvement of agriculture; and if we incidentally touch on political subjects, without entertaining any political or party bias, we only do so for the purpose of showing that all our endeavours to purge out agricultural errors, and the means of correcting them, will be but negatory, whilst those errors are the matured and preserved fruits of legislation. Providence, in His wisdom, has permitted the calamity we are now suffering under to take place, that, as an end, all may benefit by the feelings of charity that suffering humanity will ever beget; and, thanks to the Divine wisdom that disposes and searches all hearts, those feelings of charity are nobly entertained and promulgated at the present time. May they continue to actuate those on whom our destiny depends, and we will come out of this trying crisis unalloyed by the dross of agricultural ignorance, as gold from the crucible, divested of the baser metal."
"But if it be true, as is said, that ""Providence helps only those who help themselves, and as by unity of action only is the full force of power obtained, so should all be combined to strangle the deadly enemy that now has us so closely in his grasp. Yes, famine, with all its horrors of pestilence, confiscation, and death, are at every man's door, at his fireside, at his bedside—nay, in every breath of the atmosphere he inhales, and from which no one is safe, from our happy and beloved Queen on her throne, to her helpless but still beloved brother, who begs whilst he starves by the way side. The whole system, moral, social, and physical, of the United Kingdom, is besieged, whilst Ireland, the “right arm"" of the empire, is paralized, and unable to deal out a blow, even in united defence, if England, as in duty bound, does not protect her, by an unsparing advance of the ""sinews of war,"" not only by way of a loan, at even a moderate interest, but in advances and investments for her own protection."
"Writers on political economy and narrow-minded political economists will say—"" England has no right to assist in alleviating the distress that Ireland now suffers under:"" that the landed proprietors and occupiers of Ireland should be saddled with all the expenses attendant on this war of famine—for in the light of a war, a pestilential war with the elements, we must view it. A war which neither the landowners nor its occupiers could foresee; and even if they could have foreseen it, could not avert it, for the laws left them not the power. But supposing we grant what we do not believe, that the iandlords of Ireland, their agents, middlemen, tenants, and subtenants, are al/ bad. It was the law that made in the proper time, and in the proper place, enact such other laws as will protect the rights of all, the landlord as well as the tenant, and the tenant as well as the landlord—then, and not till then, need we expect permanent improvements in Ireland, no matter how we may write and talk about this species of draining, that variety of cropping, or the pure, or cross breeding of farm stock. A mutual confidence must be felt between all classes: all should share in the burdens under which the country is placed; but as all are not in a position to do So, it is the duty of the state to supply the wants which itself has caused, either directly or indirectly."
We will now put a case quite parallel to our present position. Supposing that during
"352  one night a horde of barbarians had invaded Ireland, that they had got possession of the entire food of the people, and reduced it to ashes, would not the treasury of England be at once set in motion to extirpate the invaders ? Would not her ships be "" gent in myriads to all parts of the universe to procure provisions, to supply the Irish people, so as to enable them to withstand the siege? Would not every city, town, village, and hamlet in Ireland possess a depot for the reception of provisions and distribution of rations? Yes, we say they would unquestionably; and would the English people then think of taxing the oppressed landed proprietors and landholders of Ireland, and those classes only, for the support of a war which they were no party in inviting or superinducing ? No, we say they would not attempt anything so diametrically opposed to common sense and common justice."
"We now ask the proprietors and cultivators of land in Ireland, will they, can they bear this taxation exclusively on the land ? We are as well aware as any others can be of the great and wonderful advantages already witnessed by a judicious expenditure of"
"money in the improvement of land, by draining, sub-soiling, &c., but we know, also, _"
"that if the land only be taxed for the support of the people this year, that much of the landed property of Ireland will fall into other and worse hands, as we will, at some future time, endeavour to show ; and we know that if proper steps be not taken for supplying the necessary practical instruction to the people holding small farms, so as to enable them henceforward to support themselves, that the future possessors of landed property will have a more difficult task to perform than the old but evicted hereditary proprietors would. We have offered a warning advice to the landlords and tenants of every class, and we now offer a hint to those who are panting for the property of the one, that they may become the oppressors of the others, to take care how they make a pit for their neighbours into which they may tumble themselves."
"THE MILLION ACT 9th & 10th Viet, chap. 101."
"Farmers Gazette, October 3"", 1846, page 362"
"WE beg to call the immediate attention of our readers to the operation of this Act, which is headed, and professes to be, “An Act to Authorize the Advance of Public Money, to Promote the Improvement of Land in England and Ireland, by Works of Drainage.”"
"Many of the gentry of this country are now laboring under the impression, that one MILLION of money has been placed at the disposal of the Treasury, ""to facilitate works of this kind, by advance of such sums of public money, to a limited amount, on the security of the land fo be so improved by them,"" according to the express words of the preamble of the Act."
"From this beginning would not everyone imagine that it was the intention of the government to lend and advance large sums of money from time to time to parties desirous to drain their land, and employ the people, the same to be secured upon the land that would be thus improved by it, whereby persons would be enabled at once to employ the labourers in improving their estates, and making them more"
"O  productive. In fact, that proprietors had nothing to do, but to apply to the Board of Works, state their case, and get the money advanced from time to time, as they required it."
"To our utter amazement, however, we find that such is not the fact. So far from the money being procured in this summary way, it appears that the preliminary surveys must be first paid for, and the work actually executed, before the parties can touch one penny of the loan money."
"For how stand the facts ? By the 14th section the parties are to apply for the money, their lands are to be surveyed by officers from Dublin, and they must pay for the maps, reports and surveys &c. They must then give security for costs, and after they are hung up in the Gazelle, for nearly three months, they must then apply to the Commissioners again; and now comes the most extraordinary portion or this strange Act, namely, the 17th section, which provides as follows:—""That if the Commissioners should then think that an advance should be made, they may then apply to the Treasury for liberty to issue a PROVISIONAL CERTIFICATE only to the applicant; which shall declare, that upon its being shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners, that the proposed works have been executed in a substantial and durable manner, they may then certify to the Treasury their opinion, that an advance of money should be made on account of the work so done, but so as not to exceed two-thirds of the sum actually expended upon them."
"In the name of common sense, how are the commissioners to certify that the proposed works have been executed according to their satisfaction ? Or how can the money be lent or advanced for drainage, on the security of the land to be improved by it, if the proprietors are to be obliged to raise the money first, and to execute the works themselves before they are entitled to a single penny of it—the grant."
"Again we have heard from most unquestionable authority, that the all-absorbing process of thorough draining cannot be executed under this act at all. The phrase is never once mentioned in it from beginning to end ; and are we to take it for granted that this drainage includes thorough-draining in the general acceptation of the word, or that it cannot be included in it by implication. Drainage is the only word that is used, and that may be considered by some to include thorough-draining, whilst others would think differently, for on this subject even lawyers are at variance, and many, we fear, on looking to the 5th and 6th Victoria, will say, that it is not included in the operations of the present act, under the term drainage."
"So much then for the boasted loan of a million of money to Ireland for thorough draining. It reminds us of Liston in the part of Mawworm in the play— whenever I curse, said he, I fine myself a shilling,"" and he used to take a shilling out of one pocket and put it into another."
"But seriously, an awful responsibility rests upon the framers of this blundering act, who could thus possibly delude the public at such a fearful moment. Who were the responsible advisers of the crown who framed such an act at a period that millions are looking up to it for employment and support?"
"Was it at the Castle, or the Board of Works, or the Home Office in London, or at the"
"354  Private Factory in Queen-street, Westminster, that this specimen of Imperial Legislation first saw the light ?"
"To whom is Ireland indebted for this cruel blow, this heartless mockery ? The unlimited presentment act is bad enough, hurrying as it does, the whole country to insolvency; but to tell the Irish people at such a moment, that government would lend them a million of money at 3J per cent, to thorough drain their land, and then tell them to go spend the money and employ the people first, before they would get a penny of it, was adding injury to insult."
"We are well aware of the disheartening effect that this will have upon our country friends, who are straining every nerve to avail themselves of the act, as originally represented; but the sooner they. know the truth the better, as then less injury is likely to ensue from such culpable and shameless blundering. ;"
"SUBSTITUTE FOR THE GROWTH OF THE POTATO Farmers Gazette, October 37, 1846, page 362"
"SIR — I have read with much interest the recommendations contained in the editorial article of the FARMERS' GAZETTE of the 5th instant, relative to the growth of the parsnip, as, likewise, the recommendations of yourself, and some of your correspondents, in subsequent numbers, on the culture of peas and beans, as a substitute for the potato; and I fully concur with you, in thinking that ""a much larger amount of human food can, and will be raised, by the people, when they acquire confidence in the cultivation of those crops that, to many of the poor, must be strangers."" But, why put forward your valuable suggestions as a mere ""make shift?"" We want something permanent; and it strikes me we have it in the judicious culture and combination of the very vegetables, the growth of which, you, and some of your correspondents, have recommended."
"Divine Providence having now, for two consecutive seasons, visited the potato crop with blight and decay, it is plainly inexpedient that the population of Ireland should any longer depend on it for their general support; and equally inexpedient is it, that we should become permanently dependant for our very existence upon the uncertain and irregular supplies of food which can be obtained from other countries, only by the sacrifice of that capital of which Ireland has so little, and which, consequently, it is her wisdom to employ at home, and, as far as possible, to increase, but, on no account, to part with or to lessen."
"True practical patriotism will, therefore, lead us to seek an effectual and permanent substitute of home growth, for that cheap, but not very wholesome food, of which an all-wise Providence has seen fit to deprive us; and this, in my opinion, is to be found in the combined growth of the parsnip, the bean and the pea."
"I have too much reason to fear that the small farmers contemplate growing oats and other grain crops, next season, on manure as a substitute for the potato."
"O  This besides destroying one of their chief means of paying rent, (and requiring a greater quantity of land for their subsistence) would be fatal to the progress of good husbandry; and, as every practical agriculturist is aware, must, if persevered in for four or five years, end in failure and disappointment, and then many years of judicious and scientific treatment will be required to restore to land so mismanaged, its capacity for producing grain. In order, therefore, to prevent recourse to a foreign market, on the one hand, or on the other, to the uninterrupted repetition of white crops on the same soil, either of which would, in my opinion, be fatal to the best interests of agriculture, and, consequently, of the population of this country, I would suggest, that the small farmers of Ireland should for the future, employ their manure in the growth, in due proportions of parsnips, peas, and beans, for their own consumption, and of turnips for that of their stock, to be followed as heretofore, by grain crops, &c. I purpose, if permitted, to suggest in your next number, what it appears to me these proportions should be, so as that an equal, if not a greater amount of more nutritious food shall be raised off the same extent of land, and with the application of only the same quantity of manure; but for the present, I must stop as I fear to trespass too much on your space, and on the patience of your readers. But spare me a few lines byway of conclusion; you have suggested a ""makeshift"" which ought to lie permanently adopted: allow me to suggest one, which might be of use to the small farmers in the approaching season of famine, but which certainly ought not fo be permanently adopted, viz., to sow five or six pounds of parsnip seed to the Irish acre, on their potato soil, and harrow it in now with their winter, and in February and March, with their spring corn.—"
"Yours, &c., W. LE P. TRENCH, D. D. Lissavally, Dangan, 30th Sept., 1846."
[Anything on this subject must be as acceptable to our readers as it will be gratifying to us.]
"SUGGESTIONS FOR PROVIDING FOOD FOR NEXT YEAR Farmers Gazette, October 3'%, 1846, page 362"
"siB—The very extensive failure of this year's potato crop, has necessarily caused it the first duly to provide for the immediate wants of those who have not food of their own, or the means of procuring it in the market. Yet, while this is the first duty, it is not only the one. Next to it in importance, is the providing for the year commencing, August '47."
"From the cottier who planted his rood, to the small farmer who planted his few acres, all were well acquainted with potato culture; but very few, if any, know what to sow for the coming year. Those who have access to your and other agricultural papers, and who make the necessary enquiries, will not be at a loss how to proceed; but we must not conceal it from ourselves, that their number is small when compared with those whose circumstances deprive them of such assistance. Of this, every enquiry I make but strengthens the conviction. The general reply is, ""we do not know what to do."" Some talk of manuring for corn. Would not such"
"356  a course necessarily overrun the land with weeds, and also prevent the recurrence of green crops so essential to the productiveness of the soil ? Again, even were turnips and mangel-wurzel to occupy the same breadth of land hitherto occupied by the potato, they would not be the proper substitutes."
"What those substitutes are, and how to be cultivated, the great bulk of. the agricultural population would seem to be ignorant of—that is, ignorant of the means of saving us from another year of famine."
"You were in the habit of publishing small tracts on draining, dairy management, &c. Would that you were enabled to publish monthly tracts now, teaching the small holders what to sow, and how to SOW, for the coming year. Would it be too much to hope that the Royal Agricultural Society, and the landlords generally, would undertake the expense and trouble of having them circulated amongst those who have not access to other sources of information ?"
One suggestion more and I will have done. No opportunity should be lost in
"directing public attention to the wisdom. of having the immense sums required to sustain the people, applied to draining, and to such other works as will be calculated to make the land more productive. Of all other operations connected with land, draining is the most important; and if we are to have, as we must have, the people employed at works of some description, parliament should be assembled, if necessary, to make draining imperative on those who will not avail themselves of the facilities at present afforded for it."
"Yours, &c., M., Antrim, September 30, 1846."
"LORD JOHN RUSSEL'S LETTER TO THE DUKE OF LEINSTER Farmers Gazette, October 31°', 1846, page 423"
"MY DEAR DUKE—The Royal Agricultural Society of which you are the head, sent a deputation not long ago, to the Lord Lieutenant, representing, that instead of public works of an unprofitable nature, the baronies should have power to undertake works of a useful and profitable nature. It had been our hope and expectation, that landed proprietors would have commenced works of drainage and other improvements on their own account; thus employing the people on their own estates, and rendering the land more productive for the future. In that case, it would have been only the surplus labour which would have been employed on roads and other works not immediately profitable."
"The act, however, was put in operation in the baronies, in a spirit the reverse of that which I have described. It was taken for granted that the public works were the chief objects to be regarded, and proprietors began to calculate, that as so large a sum was to be repaid from their estates, they should not be able to commence or even to continue private enterprises for the improvement of their own lands. ;"
"O  When the case was brought before the government by the Lord Lieutenant, we lamented the wrong direction in which the act had been turned; but, admitting the necessity of the case, and anxious to obtain the willing co-operation of the landlords, we authorised the Lord Lieutenant to deviate from the letter of the law and gave our sanction for advances for useful and profitable works of a private nature. But, after having incurred this responsibility, I am sorry to see that, in several parts of Ireland, calls are made upon the government to undertake and perform tasks which are beyond the power, and apart from the duties of government."
"For instance—it seems to be expected that we should not only pay at an unusual rate of wages, but that we should maintain, in this time of scarcity, the usual price of food. A moment's thought will show that this is impossible. A smaller quantity of food is to be divided among the same number of human beings. It must be scarcer—it must be dearer. Any attempt to feed one class of the people of the United Kingdom by the government would, if successful, starve another part—would feed the producers of potatoes, which had failed, by starving the producers of wheat, barley, and oats, which had not failed. All that we have under- taken with regard to food, therefore, is to endeavour to create a provision trade, at fair mercantile prices, where no provision trade has hitherto existed, and where, without assistance, none might be willing to undertake a new and unpopular occupation."
"But that which is not possible by a government is possible by individual and social exertions. Everyone who travels through Ireland observes the large stacks of corn which are the produce of the late harvest. There is nothing to prevent the purchase of grain by proprietors, or by committees, and the disposal of these sup- plies in shops furnished on purpose with flour at a fair price, with a moderate profit. This has been done, I am assured, in parts of the Highlands of Scotland, where the failure of the potatoes has been as great and as severe a calamity as it has been in Ireland."
"There is, no doubt, some inconvenience attending even these modes of interference with the market price of food. But the good overbalances the evil. Local committees, or agents of landowners, can ascertain the pressure of distress, measure the wants of a district, and prevent waste or misapplication. Besides, the general effect is to bring men together and induce them to exert their energy in a social effort directed to one spot, whereas the interference of the state deadens private energy, prevents forethought—and, after superseding all other exertion, finds itself at last unequal to the gigantic task it has undertaken."
"There are other questions, however, extending beyond the exigency of the day, which, it seems to me, demand the attention of the landed proprietors of Ireand, much more than that of the government."
"It has been calculated that one-fifth of the cultivated land in Ireland has hitherto produced potatoes. After the present lamentable failure, what course is to be taken ? Some men of science deem that the potato can no longer be depended upon as an article of food; others say that time may remove the disease. The editor of the Gardener's Chronicle states that the explanation of the potato disease,"
"358  founded on the hypothesis of some unknown miasma, cannot be accepted as satisfactory: but, neither can it be rejected, seeing how signally all other explanations have failed. Seeing, then, that science furnishes us with no means of estimating the effects of the prevalent disease upon the potato plant in future years, it would be impossible for the government, with any propriety, to give any advice to the owners or occupiers of land in Ireland. They must form their own conclusions from the facts that are known, and the experience of the present and past years."
"it is clear, however, that potatoes cannot be relied upon as they have been hitherto, a cottier cannot hope to be able to pay a large rent for con-acre, and the farmer cannot hope to obtain the coitier's labour by allowing him land for potatoes, which may, probably fail. It is, therefore, a most important question for the people of Ireland, in what manner the deficiency of food is in future to be supplied. The nature of the grain or root which is best adapted for this purpose—the course of husbandry which ought to be followed—the means of procuring seed—all these are important problems, to which the attention of the Agricultural Society of Ireland cannot too _ soon be directed. ;"
"One thing is certain—in order to enable Ireland to maintain her population, her agriculture must be greatly improved. Cattle, corn, poultry, pigs, eggs, butter, and salt provisions, have been, and will probably continue to be, her chief articles of export. But beyond the food exchanged for clothing and colonial products, she will require in future a large supply of food of her own growth or produce, which the labourer should be able to buy with his wages. In effecting this great change much good may ultimately be done. But unless all classes co-operate, and meet the infliction of Providence with fortitude and energy, the loss of the potato will only aggravate the woes and sufferings of Ireland."
"Such, then, is the great lesson which, by the influence of the higher classes, and of such good landlords as yourself, may be taught to the Irish people. They should be taught to take advantage of the favourable condition of their soil and surrounding sea; to work patiently for themselves in their own country as they work in London and Liverpool for their employers; to study economy, cleanliness, and the value of time; to aim at improving the condition of themselves and their children."
"I would here conclude this letter, which is already too long, but I cannot do so without expressing my conviction that there is every disposition in persons of pro- perty in Ireland to meet their difficulties fairly, and submit to any sacrifices which the public good may require. I remain, my dear duke, yours very faith fully,"
"(Signed) J. RUSSELL, Downing-street, October 17, 1846."
"O  LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S LETTER TO THE DUKE OF LEINSTER Farmers Gazette, October 31°, 1846, page 428"
"The Prime Minister has addressed a letter to his grace, as president of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society, a society quite incapable at present of remedying the evil complained of, on the call lately made by that body on the Government, to apply the public taxation to profitable and reproductive works, and to which we direct the attention of our readers. We know not what enlightened view they may take of it, but to us it appears to be as meagre and as unsatisfactory a document as ever emanated from official hands at such an emergency. Its style is vague—its purport unmeaning, and there is altogether a tone of imbecility about it that, considering the quarter from whence it comes, renders it peculiarly alarming at the present moment."
"The noble Lord lays the blame of the failure of the Million Act, and the General Presentment Act upon the gentry, who, very naturally, as he says, “took for granted that public works were the chief objects to be regarded,"" as the act specially referred to nothing else, and began to calculate, that as so large a sum was to be repaid from their estates, they should not be able to commence any private improvements ""of their own,"" &c."
"Surely this was the -very evil to be dreaded; for with confiscation staring them in the face, how could they possibly undertake private or profitable improvements in addition ?"
"The only important passage in the noble lord's letter that struck us, is that in which he states, that ""All we have undertaken with regard to food is to endeavour to create a provision trade, at fair mercantile prices, where no provision trade has hitherto existed, and where, without assistance, none might be willing to undertake a new and unpopular occupation."""
"If this is all that the noble lord and his colleagues have in store for us between this and Christmas, why then our case is bad indeed."
"We always thought that the noble lord was running ""too close to the wind,"" as the sailors say, and was acting on some incorrect information to confirm his resolution— the following passage proves it:—""Every one who travels through Ireland, observes the large slacks of corn which are the produce of the late harvest,"" &c."
"Ah, my lord do not rely upon that—that is a broken reed to lean upon; your informant only took a view of things from the top of the coach, and that is dangerous information to act upon. We could give you a different account, my lord, of the haggards and stacks in the south and west of Ireland, and the resources of the wretched creatures depending upon them."
"But, on the whole, the premier's letter is a most alarming one. It shows that the"
"gentry have been looking to the government, and the government to the gentry, and all of them straining their eyes most wistfully to the Board of Works; while, at"
"360  the same time, the ordinary and legitimate labours of husbandry are suspended, and a state of tilings is now before us, which can only be an aggravation of the original infliction. We really do believe that Sir Robert Peel would not have left the country in a lurch at such a moment. The energy and decision he displayed last year secured the confidence of the people, and gained him a character for boldness, combined with discretion, which is so much wanted in a minister at - such a fearful moment. Let it not be supposed we want to insinuate ought against the executive, or those connected with the government in Ireland, in our strictures - which we believe justly offered."
Farmers Gazette
"LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S LETTER TO THE DUKE OF LEINSTER Farmers Gazette, November 7"""", 1846, page 443"
"siR—In your remarks on Lord John Russell's letter to the Duke of Leinster, published in your last paper, I observe with concern that you give expression to your disapprobation in terms which (at least to me,) appear singularly inapplicable. The letter is stigmatized as being “meagre,” “unsatisfactory,” ""vague,"" ""unmeaning,"" “imbecile,” “alarming,” &c. And then, unmindful of the - fable of King Log and King Stork, you join in the cry of—how much better off we should be, if Sir Robert Peel were in power instead of Lord John Russell. Now, without wishing to detract, in the slightest degree, from the merit of the services rendered by Sir Robert Peel, in mitigating the comparatively trifling distress of last year, I may hint, en passant, that the experiment then tried by him was one which there might be some hazard in repeating. We have had frequent lessons in history of the danger of violent interference, on the part of governments, with the free course of trade. The French Revolution afforded a memorable and terrible instance of the truth of this remark."
"But to return to Lord John Russell's letter. What are the evidences of its vagueness, of its want of meaning, of its imbecility ? I confess I can find none. I are read it again and again, and, really, it seems to me just such a letter as any man of sound common sense, occupying the noble author's situation, would have written. Let us consider the letter, paragraph by paragraph, and sec whether it is not full of meaning, and wise meaning, too. Take the first paragraph (on which you offer some animadversions.) What could have been more natural than that the framers of the Act, 10 Vic., c. 107, should have hoped and expected, that landed proprietors would have commenced works of drainage and other improvements on their own account; thus employing the people on their own estates, and rendering the land more productive for the future ? In that case, his lordship justly remarks, it would have been only the surplus labour which would have been employed on roads and other works not immediately profitable; and we should have been spared a prodigious amount of taxation under the act. Precisely the same views were expressed, nearly two months ago, in a provincial journal, as follows:— The chief value of this Act, and that in which it surpasses the corresponding Acts of the session of 1845,"
"O  consists in the stimulus which it indirectly gives to the employment of capital for private purposes. Those landed proprietors who have hitherto been apathetic, or ignorant of their own real interest, in common with that of their tenantry, will begin to see a little more clearly the propriety of improving their own estates, when they recollect that they will be compelled to bear no inconsiderable part of the expense of public works from which they will not derive a corresponding benefit. They will very naturally and very reasonably conclude that it would be a much better arrangement if their money were expended in. the permanent amelioration of their own properties. They will very soon discover (or at least they ought to discover,) that money laid out at home in draining, fencing, planting, road-making, &c., will be more remunerative than a like sum ex- pended on public works, at a distance from their habitations. To be sure, they ought to have discovered this plain truth; and if they have not, who is to be blamed ? Clearly, not Lord John Russell. But, (his; lordship continues,) the proprietors feared that they should not be able to commence, or even to continue, private enterprises for the improvement of their own lands. A large number of the landed proprietors stated, with truth, that they had not the pecuniary means to undertake works of permanent improvement on a sufficiently extensive scale to meet the wants of the country, and give employment to the suffering poor. A universal outcry was raised against the extravagant manner in which the public money was squandered at Extraordinary Presentment Sessions, and a requisition was numerously signed, calling a meeting of landed proprietors in Dublin, for the purpose of pressing on the government the necessity of altering the operation of the act of parliament, so as to allow the public money to be applied to the improvement of the land, instead of being expended on useless, and unproductive works. Well, did the government, of which Lord John Russell is the head, evince any disposition to resist the wishes of the lauded proprietors? No; it anticipated them, The Lord Lieutenant promptly and boldly came forward, and, totidem verbis, said: My Lords and Gentlemen, you need not give yourselves the trouble of meeting be it unto you as you desire—the government is willing to comply with your request, it is ready to strain the act of parliament for your accommodation. Great was the joy, and manifold the thanksgivings on the occasion. The landed proprietors had obtained all they asked for; and the principle was established that an unlimited supply of money might be obtained, on loan, for the improvement of the soil of Ireland. What has been the result? Doubtless, the proprietors have largely availed themselves of the introduction of this beneficent principle, and the work of improvement goes merrily on. Alas! no. As Poor Richard says: The people heard it, and approved the doctrine, and immediately practised the contrary—just as if it had been a common sermon. Notwithstanding the golden opportunity which now exists (and which may never exist again), of introducing universal agricultural improvement, the magistrates and cess-payers, assembled at Presentment Sessions, still follow the practice of voting away the public money, by thousands and tens of thousands, for spoiling the o/d roads, and half-making new ones! Surely, Lord John Russell is not to be blamed for this. Neither is he to be blamed because, in his letter to the Duke of Leinster, he mildly expresses his disappointment."
"Seeing, then, that we have no reason to blame the miinister for not doing what it"
"362  was possible for him to do; and seeing, moreover, that a minister must, as a matter of course, be blamed for something; we are driven to the necessity of blaming him for not performing impossibilities. Accordingly, a large portion of the provincial and metropolitan press teems with editorial accusations against the government. Letters are written to the local papers—speeches are made at public meetings—resolutions are passed, condemnatory of the ministry, as well as of millers, bakers, hucksters, and forestallers. Every writer and orator has his own crotchet for the relief of the present calamitous distress of the ‘ people ; all most anxious to do everything in their power to mitigate the suffering condition of the poor; but all, at the same time, suggesting remedies the most impolitic and impracticable—and all scolding the minister for not adopting their suggestions. ""For instance,” says Lord John Russell, "" it seems to be expected that we should not only pay at an unusual rate of wages, but that we should maintain, in this time of scarcity, the usual price of food.” This is one of the most favourite speculations of the class of benevolent, but (as they appear to me) short-sighted individuals, to whom I have referred above. ""Provisions,"" say they, ""have risen to a famine price—labourers, with the"
"highest wages which they can now obtain, are unable to purchase the same :"
"amount of food as formerly; let us, therefore, urge the government to establish depots of provisions in every town, and sell them at a cheap rate to the tin a superficial view I grant that most people would pronounce this scheme unobjectionable; but, if we look a little more deeply into the subject, we shall find that the plan is impracticable, and that, even if it were practicable, it would be mischievous and ruinous. I am aware that this is not the popular doctrine, but the time has arrived when the truth should be told."
"In the first place, what is the cause of the high price of provisions? One would think that, after the almost total destruction of the food of four millions of the people, there could be but one answer to this question. And yet editors of newspapers, and speakers at public meetings of country gentlemen, clergy, magistrates, and deputy-lieutenants, are not ashamed openly to attribute the enhanced price of provisions to the ""combination of dealers in flour and oatmeal,” and the ""monopoly of heartless speculators!"" Will it be credited that, in the very newspapers in which such editorial remarks are made, and such speeches are reported, the market note will show that the price of flour bears the usual and just relation to that of wheat, and the price of oatmeal to that of oats! So that, if there be any combination to keep up the price of provisions, such combination must be amongst the farmers; but this is not pretended. The truth is, there is no combination, either among flour-dealers or farmers. The melancholy cause of the high prices is SCARCITY. We have a smaller quantity of provision in the country than in ordinary years, whilst the number of mouths is not diminished. Hence, everybody must be put on short allowance; for ""we cannot expect to eat as much food when it is scarce as when it is abundant.” When provisions fall short on board ship, every man's ration is lessened; otherwise a time would come when the whole stock would be consumed, and the crew should starve. When provisions fall short on land, where people have the privilege of purchasing as much as they can pay for, the only conceivable way in which the stock can be economized, so as so make it last till a season of plenty, is to raise the price. In a besieged town it has sometimes happened that provisions have become so scarce that bits of shoe leather, nay, rats and mice, have sold for their weight in"
O  gold.
"A rise in price is, then, a natural (I might almost say a providential) consequence of, and, in some degree, a remedy for, a scarcity of food. Moreover the temptation of a high price induces other countries to part with their surplus food for the relief of our necessities."
"lf, by the interference of government, a sale of food at ordinary prices could be enforced; or, if the government could purchase up the whole stock of food at the present high prices, and retail it at low prices, what must be the inevitable result ? Simply this: the food would not be economized; people would eat as much as in a time of plenty, as long as the supply lasted, and then they would have none—then they should starve,"
"Most wisely and benevolently, therefore. does Lord John Russell's government refuse to interfere with the regular course of trade, except in those districts in which the ordinary operations of the provision trade cannot be expected to extend. In other districts his lordship shows clearly that, even if there should be any unprincipled attempt at monopoly the proprietors and others interested in the protection of the poor have the remedy in their own hands. ""There is nothing,"" says be, ""to prevent the purchase of grain by proprietors, or by committees, and the disposal of these supplies in shops furnished on purpose with flour at a fair price, with a moderate profit. Local committees, or agents of landowners, can ascertain that pressure of distress, measures the wants of a district, and prevent waste or misapplication; besides, the general effect is to bring men together, and induce them to exert their energy in a social effort, directed to one point; whereas the interference of the state deadens private energy, prevents forethought, and, after superseding all other exertions, finds itself at last unequal to the gigantic task it has undertaken."""
"This is most true; and we would do well to weigh the matter calmly and dispassionately, much of the terror which prevails is the result of alarm. We see the poor who surround us in a state bordering on starvation; we feel our own inability to relieve them from our private resources; we dread the occurrence of outage and crime; and we willingly grasp at every scheme which offers a plausible means of release from the difficulty in which the country is placed."
"The remaining paragraphs of Lord John Russell's letter have reference to the supply of food for the people in future years. This is a question which more immediately comes under the cognizance of the body to whose president his Lordship addresses his letter. It is question which requires deep and serious thought. Perhaps, on a future occasion, I may trouble you with my views. At present I feel that my letter has run to an unreasonable length; but the importance of the subject must be my apology—"

364  ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE PEOPLE
"Farmers Gazette, November 7‘, 1846, page 444"
"Sir — As it is the important study and consideration of every good landlord in Ireland how he can employ the distressed population of his locality, I consider it . the duty of every practical and experienced agriculturist to give his opinion on how they could be most usefully employed, particularly on what works will best remunerate for the cost of labour. I beg to make a few observations relative to some work that I have had executed, and which I can prove to have more than doubly paid for the cost— it is on the great value of trenching the land. I have done some business for a gentleman in the county Monaghan these last few years—Mr. Thomas Gartlan — who had part of his land set to tenants; those tenants wore out the land by constant tillage and bad management, the result of which was, that they had to give the land up, being two years in arrears of rent. Mr. Gartlan was kind enough to forgive the arrears and take the land off their hands. The land at this time was not able to produce six barrels of oats to the acre. Mr. Gartlan immediately began to trench an ""entire farm of 20 acres 14 inches deep, and gave it about HO barrels of lime per acre when trenched. It is now tilled on the four-course rotation, and, to my knowledge, is at present able to produce from 14 to 16 barrels of wheat per acre; and 40 tons of turnips, and, of course, will be every year"
improving. This land at present is better worth £4 per acre than it was worth £7 at.
the time it was taken from the tenant.
"No man can dispute that work which will give such a return would be a most profitable way of employing the people. There is not a locality in Ireland where there could not be sufficient employment made out for the people, and in such ways, if superintened by practical men, would return more than £4 per cent, for the money expended. A great part of the tenantry could do the same work as well as the landlords, if they were only to know the value of it. Any land requiring draining should be first drained: this is the proper time of the year to do such work, as the land is free from crops, and so soft, that the work can be done with much less cost than when the ground gets dry. Another great benefit derived from trenching is the banishing of couch grass or any other weeds which the ground is subject to, and is much easier tilled than before, so much so that it will take fewer horses."
"This trenching was done by days work, but an accurate account kept of the cost; the spade and shovel work cost about sixpence per perch, which makes £4 per acre. There was as much more cost on raising large stones—some of them so large as to require blasting. There are different ways of doing this work: it can be done by putting the plough to turn the surface sod, and, taken in broad sets, putting the men to work after the plough, dividing the land to a certain number of men. The number required is very easily ascertained by measuring the ground in equal distances to each man, so as to keep them actively engaged digging a full spit deep after the plough, and throwing up as much of the subsoil as he can with the spade. Some will remain after him; but the work will be nothing the worse of that. There is another way it can be done, by giving the field a general ploughing; then beginning at the lowest side, and shoveling over four scrapes of the plough,"
"O  keeping the spades following on the second spit. Keeping two men at the spade and one at the shovel, there can be as many seta of men placed, one after the other, as the employer chooses."
"Without preparing the upland farms in this way, it need not be expected that the land will be able to produce those necessary vegetable substitutes for potatoes."
"If you consider these few lines worth inserting in your GAZETTE, it will oblige"
"Yours, &c., THOMAS FLANAGAN, Land Steward. November 3, 1846."
MEETING OF THE ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF - IRELAND
"Farmers Gazette, November 14°, 1846, pages 454-456"
"In pursuance of the requisition read at the last meeting of council, a special meeting of the members of the above society was held on Wednesday I last, at the society's office, No. 41, Upper Sackville-street."
The 14th rule alluded to in the requisition is as follows :—
"That it be a fundamental rule of the society, that no question shall be discussed at any of its meetings of a political tendency, or which shall refer to any matter to be brought forward or pending in either of the houses of parliament."
"Amongst those present we observed—His Grace the Duke of Leinster, the Earl of Erne, Sir George Hodson, Bart.; Hon. Charles J. Trench, Hon. Edward Lawless, Sir Michael Dilion Bellew, Bart.; Sir John Kennedy, Bart.; Sir Robert Kane; William Monsell, Arthur Henry, Ponsonby Moore, Jas. Raymond Barry, Charles Roper, D. J. Wilson, John Sproule, Mathew Morrison, H. W. Massy, Robert Borrowes, John La Touche, Lieut. Col. Fielding, Mathew Harrington, Andrew Armstrong, Lambert Disney, Thomas Disney, jun.; Arthur Baker, Christopher Fitzsimon, Thomas Hutton, Ulich Barklay, H. De Montinoreney, Daniel O'Connell, M.P.: A. M, O'Grady, M.D.; Henry Smith. A. H. lload, George Green, Thomas Birmingham, Hans Hamilton Woods, Calvert Stronge, Henry J. M'Farlane, Pierce Mahony, Charles Wm. Hamilton, Thomas Ball, H. W. Barrington. Charles Filgate, Denis Lucas, Conyngham Ellis, M.C.; Cramer Roberts, Pierce Joseph Blake, J. Shaw, J. B. Bankhead, David Charles La Touche, Arthur Baker, Alexander M'Carthy, M.P.; D. P. Shea, F. W. Etheredge, Esqrs."
"At half-past one o'clock the chair was taken by his Grace the Duke of Leinster. The secretary (Mr. Edward Bullen) stated that the present special meeting of the society had been called in pursuance of a requisition of members, most numerously"
"signed, for the purpose of suspending the operation of the 14th general rule of the society, to enable the society to take into their consideration the questions of"
"366  profitable and reproductive labour—general and thorough drainage, sub-soiling and clearing of land, and the production of food in the present emergency (héar, hear)."
"After some objection to the shortness of the notice, which appeared to have been published in the evening papers of Friday and Saturday, Mr. Charles Roper then came forward. He said that he rose to move the first resolution, which was similar in wording to the requisition, namely—""That under the existing circumstances of the country we agree to suspend the fourteenth rule, so far as to enable the society to express their opinions as to the profitable and reproductive employment of the people, the general and thorough drainage, sub-soiling and clearing of land, and the production of food at the present crisis."" In doing so he wished to state at once, that it was not intended to abrogate or annul the fourteenth general rule of the society, but was merely intended to suspend the operation of the rule, for the purpose of enabling them to express their opinions upon certain important -questions; and he hoped to be able to satisfy the meeting that they could do so (hear, hear), and that the rule was divided into two parts, one of which would not be interfered with, and one of which he expected to see suspended (hear, hear). The rule was as follows:—""That it be a fundamental rule of the society that no question shall be discussed at any of its meetings of a political tendency, or which shall refer to any matter to be brought forward, or pending, in either of the houses of parliament."" Now he (Mr. Roper) objected to the latter paragraph of this rule, which prevented them from referring to matters which were or might be pending before parliament; and if it was to remain in force, still to restrict them, they could not consider any of those important questions which he alluded to, and were suggested to every man's mind by the awful state of distress in the country (hear, hear). He (Mr. Roper) would show the society that, in point of fact, it had not acted for nearly twelve months in accordance with it, and that it was virtually suspended in November, 1845 (hear, hear). In that month Mr. Mahony had proposed a resolution to be presented to government upon the expediency of providing employment by drainage and other reproductive works; and if that was not a recommendation for some modification of the law, he could not tell what it was—for he should have mentioned that the motion was adopted and presented (hear, hear). The learned gentleman here read a lengthened report, approved of by the deputation appointed to wait on Sir Thomas Fremantle, with the resolution alluded to, and said that it clearly showed that Mr. Mr. George Alexander Hamilton and the other gentlemen deputed to wait on the government, had referred to acts of parliament, and spoke of facilities of bringing in certain measures (hear, hear). Now, that he (Mr. Roper) submitted was virtually a violation of the letter of the fourteenth general rule which he now wished to have suspended (hear, hear). That took place in November, 1845, and in the year 1846, towards the close of the late session, a measure was proposed and carried in parliament in a few days, to relieve the distress arising from the failure in the potato crop—a measure which did more to - effect the landed interest of the country than any measure ever passed previously (loud cries of hear, lear). He alluded, of course, to the labour rate act (hear, hear). The passing of this important and necessary act called for some movement in that society, Mr. Monscll had not thought it too much trouble to come to town, and to lay his views before its members, and to tell them what he considered most important, namely, the carrying out of reproductive works. He was then in the council of the society, and his proposition was approved of at a very full meeting;"
"©  but when the matter was subsequently brought before the society on one or two occasions, it was always interrupted by a reference to the 14th general rule. Now the society had, in fact, approved of his suggestions, and had afterwards disapproved of them (hear, hear). At one meeting, Mr. George Alexander Hamilton stood up, when the question was raised, and argued that the consideration of these _ matters was not a violation of the 14th general rule, and the majority present concurring with him, they proceeded to consider the proposition of Mr. Monsell (hear). Now, although this took place in a meeting of the council of the society, consisting of 40 member's, as he had said, gentlemen subsequently got up to obstruct their proceedings when reference was made to Mr. Monsell's motion; and it was owing to this obstruction that they considered it necessary to call a general meeting, to have the question formally settled—to have the society finally declare whether or not it would consent then to have done what the council had frequently done (hear, hear). The amount of the sum that should be raised to supply the consequences resulting from the loss of the potato was immense (hear, hear); and if that large sum was to be expended on roads, bridges, aqueducts, and unproductive works, at a time when the reproduction of the land was called for, it would alarm him and others as to the ultimate consequences to the country. They should remember it was not a question of thousands, but a question of millions (hear). Lord John Russell, in his letter to his grace, had stated that the potato crop occupied one-fifth of the arable area in Ireland (loud cries of hear, hear). Now, if that were the case, it must strike every one as to the dreadful loss sustained; and also the vast quantity of other articles of food that would be required to supply the deficiency (hear, hear). Colquhoun averaged the potato crop of Great Britain as worth £16,000,000, and McCullagh said it was value for at least £12,000,000. Such was the extent of the loss sustained by the country (hear, hear)—and it was well known that it would take three acres of corn to supply, as an article of food, one of potatoes; so that the produce of 3,900,000 acres of corn would be required to supply the loss of 1,300,000 of potatoes (hear, hear). Now, if there were to be an expenditure of money to be raised off the land, and that that money was not to be reproductively expended— that they were to go on with a compulsory taxation for the employment of the people on unproductive and useless works (loud cries of hear, hear)—and that the money was to go out of the country to buy foreign food, the matter would be soon wound up (hear, hear). If they could not fill up the gap made in the country, things would be soon brought to a stand still (hear, hear). The trade of Indian corn would, no doubt, open another branch of business to the English manufacturer."
"The Duke of Leinster here interrupted the learned gentleman, and said—This is the very inconvenience I find in this question. You are now entering into a subject of political economy."
Mr. Roper—I beg pardon.
"The Duke of Leinster—I have listened with great interest to you, but this is not the room for such discussion (hear, hear)."
"Mr. Roper—I merely refer to the necessity of our assisting ourselves, instead of"
"depending on others for food; and I only ask to suspend this rule to enable us to do so (hear, hear)."
"368  The learned gentleman here read the following letter from the Earl of Clancarty, chairman of the council:.—"
"My DeaR MR. BULLEN—I regret that business will prevent my attending the general meeting of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society, specially summoned for to- morrow by order of the council."
"I beg to say that I concur in the objects of the requisionists. I am of opinion, that by the suspension of the 14th rule of the society, much useful discussion might take place among persons the best qualified to afford to the government such information in reference to the profitable and reproductive employment of the people, as may be necessary in the present emergency. I would suggest, however, that the proposed suspension of the 14th rule should be strictly limited to a certain period, (say six months, or until the next general meeting of the society,) and that the ordinary business of council should be invariably disposed of before any questions heretofore excluded by the said rule be introduced. The relaxation of the rule will thus be unaccompanied with any risk, or should it be found after the present crisis shall have passed to have been fraught with any danger to the usefulness of the society, the rule will, at the expiration of the proposed period, revive in all its stringency. I cannot, however, but think that in a country circumstanced as Ireland is, i.e., dependent wholly upon its agriculture, and that agriculture in the greatest need of encouragement and wise direction, it would be most advantageous that there should be a recognised body, to which, upon special occasions, and upon questions of such practical import, as, for instance, the employment of the agricultural population, the government could refer for information; and, inasmuch as the society does or ought to include among its members, all who are in a position to promote the industrial welfare of the country, I think it would both strengthen the hands and improve the usefulness of the institution to permit, with proper limitations, the discussion generally of subjects having a direct and practical bearing upon agricultural improvement. Believe me to be, faithfully yours,"
"CLANCARTY. Garbally, November 10, 1846."
"Letters were also read by the secretary from Thomas Bolton Esq., of Ballykistcon, in favour of the proposition, and from Sir William Jackson Honan, Bart., and James L. W. Naper, Esq., vice-president, against entertaining it."
"Mr. Roper proceeded to observe that his lordship was a high authority on such a subject, and then said he thought it had been mischievously attempted, and he regretted it very rnuch, to introduce this letter as a political one, and to mix up the name of Mr. O'Connell with it (hear, hear). Mr. O'Connell, he admitted, had but lately joined them, but they had many valuable members on their books who disapproved of the society at first, and afterwards joined it (hear, hear). The Duke of Leinster — The Earl of Clancarty, for instance (hear, hear)."
"Mr. Roper replied that such was the case, and the only difference was, that Mr. O'Connell took a longer time to become a convert (laughter). Mr. O'Connell had not joined them, he believed, with any political motive, but in order to do what he"
"Cc  could to benefit the country under its existing distress (hear, hear)."
"Mr. O'Connell— My Lord Duke, I beg the learned gentleman's pardon for a moment. I came here to obey our rules, and not to contradict them — I carne to be one of you — to be obedient to all your laws and regulations; and, if my presence causes any unpleasantness here or elsewhere, I shall retire (loud cries of no, no). With that demonstration I am satisfied."
"Mr. Roper proceeded to say that the agricultural society was never a political body, and would be one for the first time if it objected to Mr. O'Connell, and, then, in conclusion, moved the resolution suspending the 14th general rule."
"Mr. Thomas Ball seconded the motion, which was put, and declared to be carried, although the following proceeding showed that there was some misconception in the announcement."
"Mr. Wilson then came forward. He said that the meeting had been called rather more quickly than he would have wished, but there was no alternative. The accounts of distress throughout the country were increasing day after day, and a special meeting was necessary (hear, hear). The resolution which he wished to propose was one which was more distinct and definite than that proposed by Mr. Roper. lt was to the effect:"
"""That it is the opinion of the meeting, that in the present state of the country, it is advisable to suspend so much of the 14th general rule, as prevents the Society ‘from referring to any matter to be brought forward or pending in either house of parliament, in order to enable the society to express their opinions as to the employment of the people, on drainage, sub-soiling, and clearing of the land, and the production of food at the present crisis; and that the suspension of the said portion of the rule above referred to, be extended to the general meeting of the society, to be held in the spring of the year 1847."""
"Mr. La Touche said he was loath to obtrude himself upon the time of the meeting if the question had already been irrevocably decided. He had been waiting for some person better qualified than he was to express the opinion of a large body of dissentient; and he wished to know from his Grace if the matter was decided or not. He for one thought that if the sense of the meeting were taken, the decision would be found to be the very reverse of that which it had been declared to be."
"His Grace the Duke of Leinster was understood to say, that he considered the matter had been finally settled."
"Mr. La Touche said that the well-wishers of the society (and he claimed for himself such a designation) were unwilling that a question of such importance should * be decided without taking the sense of the meeting. He had no doubt that if the real sense of the members were taken, the decision would be quite the opposite way."
"His Grace observed, that if any one had called for a division at the time, he would, of course, have assented to it."
370  Mr. LaTouch could assure his Grace that he had done so. His Grace said that he did not hear him.
The Hon. Edward Lawless said it was quite open to any member to call for a division.
"Mr. La Touche said he would move that the society should strictly adhere to the 14th rule, that no question should be discussed at any of their meetings having a political tendency. A great deal however, had been said by Mr. Roper, in which he agreed, yet he thought it would be opening a loop-hole to the introduction of subjects that would inevitably destroy their society, because in a country so situated as Ireland was, there were no subjects so exciting as those of a political. character; and the politics of this country were so interwoven with agriculture, that if they debated the tendencies of acts of parliament, division and discussion amongst them, must inevitably be the consequence. Their society was doing great good, and he begged of the gentlemen around him net to be precipitate, but to consider before they abolished a fundamental rule upon which they had worked so far, and which was essential to the proper working of the society."
"Mr. Roper said, that if any gentleman was under a misapprehension as to the sense of the meeting having been ascertained, he and every gentleman with whom he suited, were not unwilling that a division should take place, in order that the opinion of the meeting might be testified. He did not desire anything but the candid and open declaration of that meeting."
"Mr. Monsell, of Tervoe, said he conceived that the better way would be for Mr. Roper to withdraw his resolution."
"After some discussion, Mr. Roper yielded to the suggestion, and having withdrawn his resolution, that proposed by Mr. Wilson WAs placed before the chair."
"Mr. La Touche said he felt it rather invidious to make any observations upon a resolution which seemed framed at first sight in a manner that was perféctiy harmless. Nothing could be more necessary than to discuss the points that had been touched upon in Mr. Monsell's letter. His Grace saw the tendency of that, and objected to its being entertained; out of that the present discussion arose, and what would spring from that discussion was not very difficult to anticipate. Although at first sight it appeared to be invidious and unpopular that the resolution should be opposed, he for one, although he was not seconded in his amendment, would raise his voice against a departure from the original principle of that society; and he did not think they had the power of departing from their fundamental rule, which was— that all political questions, and even matters which could not strictly be called political, such as were likely to become the subject of discussion in parliament, should be excluded from their debates. That society had proved itself to be most useful, not only in what it had done, but likewise in the encouragement and stimulus which it had given to others. In conclusion he moved, “that the society do strictly adhere to its 14th fundamental rule—' that no question shall be discussed at any of its meetings of a political tendency, or which shall refer to any matter to be brought"
"O  forward, or pending in either house of parliament.”"
"The Hon. E. Lawless said that he had great pleasure in seconding the resolution. He did not differ with Mr. Roper—all he had said was founded in fact—but that not a place to discuss political questions; their business was of a practical nature, and political discussions, particularly in this country, were seldom or never practical. In his opinion, country gentlemen would be better employed upon their estates and in their neighbourhoods than in discussing crotchets in that society, upon which scarcely three of them would be found to agree. They would have a good deal of talk and plausibility, but very little that would prove useful."
"Mr. Pierce Mahony said that in 1845 he proposed what would be a departure from the rules of the society, being ignorant that such rules had any existence. Those who surrounded him thought him not only justified in- proposing the resolution, but the government in part adopted their suggestion. If he had erred, he was in excellent company, for the premier had addressed a letter to the noble chairman upon the subject. He came to that meeting because he looked upon that society as constituted of practical men who were determined to do their duty by the country as they found it. Mr. Monsell had followed up what he had done, and his proposition had been adopted. If Mr. La Touche were to propose a resolution, it should be one of censure upon the council and Lord John Russell for having addressed his Grace. He hoped that the gentlemen would consider the consequences that would spring from resisting the passing of the resolution—a wider society would be established for the sentiments of men, which were of vast importance, and which were struggling to get vent, were too strong to be concealed."
"Mr. C. W. Hamilton observed that if the society did not adopt the resolution, he had no doubt that before Monday, another society would spring into existence; and if this were the case, it would be more difficult to restrain them within the bounds which they desired to have observed for themselves. Would they then allow it to be said that they had shrunk from their duty from an apprehension of involving themselves in difficulty, and from a consciousness of insufficiency to meet the wants of the country, and allowed another society to do what they should, have done. The danger of taking an opposite course from that of adopting the resolution was so great, that from that moment they might dwindle into insignificance."
"Mr. Bermingham said that he had come there to assist the poor man, and he was satisfied that his grace, who had guided them so well through all their difficulties, was only anxious to do good to his fellow man, without distinction of classes or degrees."
"The Chairman then put the amendment, which was negatived. A division was called for, and his grace declared that ""the Noes had it."" He then put the original resolution, and declared that it had passed."
"Mr. Monsell then said that it became his duty, the society having affirmed the"
"principle that the subject of the resolution could be introduced, to bring forward a motion to the following effect:—"
"372  ""That this society do now constitute itself a committee, to sit from day to day, take such measures as may appear advisable for obtaining accurate information respecting the extent of benefit to be derived from the present mode of providing employment, and the deficiencies of the same ; to report on such amendments as full deliberation should indicate to be desirable, and respectfully to submit to the consideration of the proper authorities from time to time such representations as those inquiries may supply, thus embodying. the collective experience and observation of the society at large."" Sir Michael D. Bellew seconded the motion which passed."
"Mr. K. Fowler then proposed the following resolution : ""That it is the opinion of the society that it would be of the 'Highest importance if the council would still further impress upon the proper authorities the necessity of making the townland the unit of subdivision as to assessment, in place of the electoral division, and that any proprietor undertaking the amount of the cess to be levied off each townland, should be exonerated from the extra assessment on the barony, such being the object of the deputation from the provisional committee of requisitionists on profitable and reproductive labour that lately waited on Mr. Labouehere, on the 15th October last for that purpose."
He suggested this resolution to the society as one which they should adopt.
Mr. C. W. Hamilton said he would second the proposition with the thorough conviction that the principle which it contained was calculated to give contentment and satisfaction to the country (hear).
"Mr. Monsell supported the resolution, and called upon the gentlemen of the north and east of Ireland, who were not suffering so much as those of the south and the west from the visitation of Providence, to assist them upon that occasion (hear, hear). If those around him had seen the distress which he had seen, and the totally unproductive works in places where money expended on the drainage of the land might have doubled the value of the estates, they would agree with him in opinion that the resolution should be adopted (hear)."
"Mr. O'Connell said that coining, as he did, from Mr. Monsell's part of the country, he could say that it would be utterly impossible to carry out Mr. Labouchere's plan if they confined it to the electoral divisions. So many different interests were to be consulted—so many could not consent by reason of their minority, if they followed out the plan of an electoral division, that it would give rise to great confusion; but if they acted upon the principle of townlands the process could be simplified by having a deal with a single individual in each townland. Before he =at down he owed to the meeting to say, that he had not brought any particle of his politics into that room. Ke did not deny that he was a politician elsewhere, but he hoped that nobody would discover from his conduct in that society what he was (hear, hear, hear)."
A short discussion having ensued as to the advisibility of adopting the
"resolution, in which the Honorable Mr. Trench joined, and dissented from it on the ground that a division of townlands would not prove satisfactory to the country, the"
"QO  resolution was put and passed; after which Sir George Hodson was called to the chair, and thanks having been returned to his Grace the Duke of Leinster for his dignified conduct in the chair, the meeting separated."
MEETING OF THE ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF IRELAND
"Farmers Gazette, November 14"", 1846, page 457"
"THIS important meeting took place, on Wednesday last, at the society's rooms, in Sackville-street. His Grace the Duke of Leinster, President of the society, in the chair."
"On the object contemplated in calling this meeting we will offer no remark, at present, beyond expressing a hope that the society will be able by a judicious course of proceeding, to produce mutual confidence amongst all classes of the agricultural community. Anything short of that, on the part of the Boyal Agricultural Improvement Society, or any other society, as far as its sphere of action can extend its influence, wil, fall so far short of what should be its legitimate objects. As members of the society, we can now, without let or hindrance, at least, watch its proceedings, which we hope to do on every possible opportunity. The proceedings which we now give are taken from the Sounders’ News-Letter, and which will, we hope, be read with much interest. The only parts left out are those with which the public, generally, would feel little interest."
"Since writing the above, we find we have been perhaps a little too sanguine in supposing that all members will be permitted to take part in the committee's pro- ceedings without further qualification than that of being ordinary members. We find now that an additional pound must be paid down to insure such qualification. To qualify in this manner, for taking a part in such proceedings, politically speaking, as may be necessary for government guidance, on what are termed parliamentary measure may be quite legitimate, but that such qualification should be necessary in men who would volunteer their aid, and offer to sacrifice their time, in assisting to supply the poor farmers with practical information in the management of their wretched farms, is a species of the art which we i have now, for the first time, heard of. To require practical men to make such a great sacrifice, is, in our opinion, highly injudicious; nay, the reverse of what it should be—namely, that men of sound practical judgment, and of unquestionable characters, should be admitted, nay, solicited to become honorary members or associates, to assist the less-experienced but rich members in supplying the farmers with useful instruction, which is to them, at the present time, of much greater importance than the existence or suspension of the 14th rule or standing order."
"We hope now, that the proceedings of the society will be open to the press, that the public may judge of the ,good likely to result from such associations.'; and that members of the society, because they may happen to be connected with the press, will not in future be excluded from the deliberations going on, much less be"
"374  required to lay down a pound additional, to qualify them for such attendance."
"Our suggestion in this respect is designed for a twofold object—first, to secure to the society, the services of the press, and secondly, to secure to the public, a faithful representation."

"The Secretary laid on the table the premium sheet, as proposed to be framed for the next Great Annual Cattle Show of the Society, to be held in Londonderry in the month of August. Ordered, that the same be referred to Acheson Lyle, Robert Orr, and John Martin, Esqrs., to consider the same, and to make the necessary ar- rangements for the purpose ; and that a copy be also sent to the Royal Flax Society of Ireland, to solicit their co-oporation on the occasion. ."
"On the motion of Mr. Monsell, seconded by Mr. Richard Bourke, the following were admitted members of the Society— The Earl of Dunraven, Adare Manor; Henry O'Grady, Esq., The Grange, Limerick; Thomas O'Grady, Esq., The Grange, Limerick; Richard Quin Slacman, Esq., Cahara House, Glin; Henry Maunsell, Esq., Limerick; Wyndham Fitzgerald, Esq., Limerick; Francis Spaight, Esq., Derry Castle, Killaloe; Joseph Gabbett, Esq., Limerick; Rev.

"Hon. C. J. Trench (supported by Thomas R. Hardy, Esq.), gave notice that he would move at the next meeting of the council, to adopt such measures, either by subcommittee or otherwise, as might appear advisable, for procuring the moat practical information for the farming classes, as to the necessary change in the cultivation of land, incident to the universal failure of the potato crop."
"The Secretary read the following letter from his Grace the Duke of Leinster, President of the Society :"
"O  SIR — The special general meeting of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland, having yesterday decided to suspend, until April, 1847, the latter part of the Fourteenth Rule of the Society, I consider it will be impossible to prevent matters totally unconnected with the object of the Society from being discussed. I beg, therefore, to resign the honour of being their President, and request that you will have the goodness to inform the Council of my determination — I am, Sir, your obedient servant,"
"LEINSTER., Carton, Maynooth, 12th November, 1846."
"The following resolution was unanimously agreed to — That the council have received, with much regret, the letter addressed to them by His Grace the Duke of Leinster, their noble president, to whose uniform kindness and co-operation the society are so much indebted, and will lay his letter before the general meeting of the society, at which the usual election of its officers will take place; and they hope that the constant abstinence, in the meantime, from all discussions, unconnected with the objects of the society, may prove that His Grace's apprehensions will not be justified by any departure, on the part of the society, from the spirit which dictated the law in question."
"It was also ordered that the managing committee should meet on Saturday next, at two o'clock, in order to make the necessary arrangements for the next stated general meeting of the society, on the 12th of December, to receive the annual report of the council, and to prepare the premium sheet for the cattle show, in Lon- donderry."
"The Secretary stated that the Committee on Profitable and Reproductive Works, appointed at the late special meeting of the society, had met during the past week, and discussed the different subjects referred to its consideration, and had prepared the following memorial, which was then presented for the approval of the council: To His Excellency the Earl of Besborough, Lord Lieutenant General and General Governor of Ireland, &-c. The Memorial of the undersigned Proprietors and Occu- piers of Land in Ireland,"
"HBMBLT SHEWETH—That your Memorialists received with great satisfaction the announcement contained in Mr. Secretary Labouchere's letter of the 5th October last, to the Chairman of the Board of Public Works, that your Excellency was prepared to give a more extended operation to the Act for the Employment of the labouring poor of this country, than was contemplated by the original provisions of that law."
"That with a view of availing themselves of the construction which your Excellency appeared thus prepared to sanction, your Memorialists directed their immediate attention to the introduction of the system of Reproductive Works into their respective districts, but they regret to be compelled to state, that, for one or more of the following reasons, they are of opinion that in the majority of cases it is impossible to carry out your Excellency's views in the manner directed by Mr. Laboucherc's letter."
376  1st.-Because it is scarcely possible to discover works of such universal benefit as will render them profitable or reproductive to all owners and occupiers in any Electoral Division. :
"2nd_ Because, by the terms of Mr. Labouchere's letter, Drainage, in connection with Subsoiling appears to be the only work of a private character, authorized as a substitute for Public Works; whereas, in many districts of Ireland, Thorough Drainage is not required, though sub-soiling may be carried on advantageously, while in others,"
"works of a totally different character, such as clearing, fencing, or the making of farm:"
"roads, ire the chief works to which labor could at present be iiost beneficially applied."
"3rd _ Because in cases of works, the cost of which to be made an exclusive charge on the lands to be mproved, as specified in paragraph No. 4 of Mr. Labouchere's letter, it is necessary to the just opera-ion of the system, that each and every proprietor hould undertake his own proportion of the sum to which the electoral division is assessed; and this unanimity it is seldom possible to attain for various reasons, which will occur to all practical persons. The number if electoral divisions in Ireland is about 2,050, containing a large number of townlands, chiefly in the hands of separate proprietors, of whom many are absentees, whose consent it is almost impossible to obtain; others are lunatics or infants, or strict tenants for life, in which cases, there are many difficulties and impediments to obtaining the required guarantee; whilst some may be in such embarrassed circumstances, that the whole rental of their property is absorbed in payment of interest money and expenses ; or a few proprietors may prefer a public road to private works, and by their opposition, counteract the wishes of the majority for ;he adoption of reproductive Works, in their elec-;oral division. Any of these causes would, in the opinion of your mcmoralists, cither render inoperative the relaxation of the law contemplated by your Excellency, or so embarrass the proceedings of those who choose to avail themselves of its provisions, as to render their ifforts for that purpose totally unavailing."
"Your memorialists are, indeed, well aware, that by the interpretation given to Mr. Labouchere's letter, if a portion only of the assessment on an electoral division is expended on productive works, the general amount of rate will be thereby reduced,"
"- but they submit to your Excellency, that, in practice, this will seldom, i ever, be carried out; because it cannot be expected that a proprietor will submit both to the direct charge incurred for drainage, or other improvement of his property, (which it must be remembered is imposed soley for the sake of employing the destitute poor) and like wise to that proportion of the general rate, which i cast upon him by the refusal of other proprietors t< undertake their own share. Such a state of thing would not only involve the enterprising proprietor in o double expense, but would in precisely the same pro portion, relieve his negligent neighbours from thei allotted share of the burden."
"To obviate these difficulties, aftd to carry out the principle which your Excellency has so wisely recognized, viz., that the amount of taxation necessary to meet the present emergency shall be expended upon reproductive works, your memorialists respectfully submit, that each proprietor, or combination of two or more proprietors, who may be willing to charge their proportion of the rate for employing the poor, upon any particular land to be improved thereby, shall be entitled to have it expended on such land, and be relieved to that extent from the payment of rate; and that the works so to be undertaken, need not be confined to drainage,"
"O  or sub-soiling--. but may include all works of a reproductive nature, suited to the wants of the locality for which they are proposed, provided only that such works meet with the approbation of the Board of Public Works."
"Your memorialists humbly beg to remind your Excellency, that in this request they but seek to avail themselves of your Excellency's intentions, without the necessity of a combined movement on the part of every proprietor in an electoral division. That by these suggestions the details of the system are by no means rendered more complicated or difficult, but on the contrary, that the adoption of townlands, in preference to electoral divisions, will be found in practice more simple and easy, and in its results productive of this great advantage, that it will turn the current of labour into profitable channels. Your memorialists, therefore, humbly but earnestly ray your Excellency to enlarge the terms by which our Excellency's intentions are at present limited, and o declare, that any townland which shall expend in laboui pon drainage or other productive works, its proper-ion of the sum assessed on the barony in which it is situated, shall be exempt from further taxation undei he provision of the 9th and 10th Victoria, chap. 10— and that the same principle shall be extended to cases rhere two or more proprietors, of separate townlands, hall for this purpose agree to act in concert."
"And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever ray."
Signature. I (ascription. I Residence. I Post Town.
"It was ordered that the above memorial should be received and printed, and that copies of it should be circulated and forwarded to the chairmen of (lie different relief committees now sitting in Ireland, and also to the secretaries of the several local farming societies in con-ection with the central one, for signatures and approval, previous to being transmitted to the proper authorities."
"The following are the resolutions which were proposed by D. J. Wilson, Esq., and negatived:—"
"Resolved—That the communication of his Grace the }uke of Leinster resigning the Presidency of the Royal Agricultural Society, in consequence of the passing of a resolution, at the late General Special Meeting of the Society, for a temporary suspension of the 14th rule, has been received by the Council with very great regret. That being satisfied his Grace (solely actuated by a conscientious feeling) came to this decision after mature consideration, we feel it would be useless to press upon him a request to withdraw his resignation, and still continue our President."
"Resolved—That this Council do recommend to the General Meeting now about to be held, that the office of President of the Society be left vacant until the General Meeting to be held in Easter next, in order that we may be in a position to replace his Grace in the Chair, which he filled from the formation of the Society, where his every act was marked by a sincere and undeviating desire to advance its interests, and his deportment such as to command the esteem and respect of every member of the body."

"THE POTATO CROP Farmers Gazette, November 28, 1846, page 485-486"
"Incapable of tracing the potato disease to any cause which will bear examination, in conjunction with the various facts which have been developed during the progress of the disorder, I am one of those who have fallen back upon the vulgar opinion, that we are indebted for the visitation to those atmospheric peculiarities which so frequently produce epidemic disease, and to which the vegetable and animal world are alike subject."
"There may be nothing very taking in this theory and it certainly is not novel enough for those philosophical epicures who have, for some time been in the habit of having a potato theory, like their breakfast butter, ""fresh from the country,” every morning; at the same time it is a safe one, inasmuch as it, is better to make our passage in a ferry-boat than to.be wrecked in a yacht of our own; and the opinion which attributes to the disorder an epidemic origin and nature, to use the language of Professor Lindley, ""as it explains an unknown cause by unknown agency, is the last and best refuge of theorists; for it is alike incapable of proof and ‘disproof. ."
"While other causes, then, do not satisfy the conditions of the problem—while other theories can be disproved, this one, which cannot be negatived, may at least be tolerated; although by calling to our assistance an invisible agency when no visible one can be found, and by attributing the affection to the unknown influences which produce epidemic complaints amongst animals, or to causes similarly obscure, we add another to the list of ""ills"" of the cause and cure of which we are equally ignorant, and which the farmer, to use a vulgar saying, must ""grin, and bear; and another to the ""mysteries of agriculture,"" of which class the mildew, the clover sickness, the murrain, and pleuro-pneumonia, &c., are well-known representatives."
"Actuated by these impressions, I have for some time had hopes of the crop,"" and have expressed a confident expectation that the disease, like most other epidemics, would be general in its attacks, but partial in its effects, and would injure but not exterminate this useful vegetable."
"To this opinion, and the theory on which it is based, I now allude, because facts have fully confirmed my sanguine expectations. What was hope is now certainty— the results of the potato harvest showing that the progress of the disorder has been stayed, and that the injury done to the crop by the malady is not nearly so great as was anticipated."
"I am aware that this will startle many who have given up the crop as lost. It is not the first time, however, that stage-coach observers have been too hasty in their opinions, or that interested parties have turned a public evil into a private good, by keeping up a ""cry."" To the public, however, the disappointment will be an agreeable one, and I therefore do not hesitate to confirm, and publicly announce the fact,"
"O  which has already begun to be whispered, that so far as regards this district (central Yorkshire) the potato crop is turning out much better than was anticipated; that the tubers tainted with the malady have made no progress towards putrefaction of late, that they have not increased in number, and that they form a very small proportion of the crop,"
"As we are now in the midst of the potato harvest, the truth of these assertions is evident to all. It is true that all crops have been blighted in the stem and leaves, and the effect of this was to stop the growth at too early a period; hence our sample is small, and the bulk of the crop below an average; at the same time, many acres which exhibit these symptoms of the disorder in their leaves have not a single diseased tuber."
"It has been truly said that fear misleads us as often as hope deceives us, and this is a case in point; not more than from five to ten per cent, of the winter potatoes grown in this neighbourhood being tainted with the complaint."
"Early potatoes were much injured, but it is the winter potatoes that are of most importance, and they have escaped in a great measure. That they will keep when stored I think we may safely conclude, as the disorder has made no progress during the last few-weeks. I know this not merely from general observation of the produce grown in this district, but from careful examination of the potatoes taken out of the field daily for our family consumption. In these the per centage of the disease has not increased during the last few weeks, while previous to that time each day appeared to add to the numbers of the ""plague-stricken."""
"Our potato dealers, too, appear to be pretty confident that the malady has exhausted itself for this season, as they are buying largely at liberal prices per acre, in which case they have the risk of keeping; and their experience makes them authorities worth quoting."
"On the whole, therefore, taking into account the loss from the disorder, and the deficient weight of the crop, the yield in this part of the country is two-thirds of an average crop; and, if this estimate be equalled in other potato-growing districts, I do not see any reason why we should fear having a fair supply of potatoes during the winter, or why they should be sold at exorbitant; prices, and should advance in price, except with other; descriptions of food, and pari pasu. At present, however, they have risen 200 per cent., while wheat has. advanced from 25 to 30 per cent, in price."
"that the abundant supply of turnips will render it unnecessary, as the cry of scarcity will make it impolitic for the farmer to give any potatoes (which are generally and under ordinary circumstances used largely) for cattle and horses; and that the vegetable has been, and will continue to be used with more than ordinary economy—three considerations which, in my opinion, will amply compensate for the deficiency in the crop, and enable us to obtain a sufficient supply for winter consumption, from a crop somewhat below the usual average.—"
"John Hannam, in Times."
"380  EDITORIAL Farmers Gazette, November 28"""", 1846, page 489"
"THE awful state of the country, not only as regards the starving poor, but also the not much less deplorable condition of the once rich—but now on the verge of being ruined—landlords of Ireland, demands that an incessant and unanimous pressure from without should be kept on the government of the. country, to introduce, without delay, and to pass, with all the haste that a judicious policy will admit, some measures of relief for the small farmers of Ireland ere they all become paupers, and with them their victimized landlords. The glorious uncertainty of the laws lately passed, with every change made, and every explanation given, by its administrators and staff officers, tend but to render confusion more confounded. The belief of the country has been, that the taxation for the relief of the starving labourers, would be swallowed up by a lisping, mustachoed, self- sufficient, staff of pseudo engineers, of such a heterogenious character as to aggravate the evils that famine has produced, perpetuate the misery the poor have been deemed to suffer, and ultimately become possessors of the property of the country, confiscated, by their own agency."
"Foreseeing all this from the beginning, we at once raised our humble voice against it, in warning the proprietors of landed property against the ruin that awaited them ; but, thinking it was but an experiment, we resolved to wait and give it a practical trial. We accordingly waited on the Board of Works—first, to test the truth of the sad report; and, secondly, to set an example in applying for a portion of the grant to be expended in the only legitimate way in which it should, or can be expended—namely, in reproductive works that would, by such expenditure, relieve the land on which it would be expended, of taxation to an equal amount. We were told the law did not admit of such an application, and were also distinctly told by Mr. Mulvany, that the staff we complained of would be paid by the government, and that proprietors applying for the grant could appoint their own engineers and superin- tendents, subject, and very properly so, to the approval of the Board of Works."
"We then believed, and still believe, the great sincerity evinced by Mr. Mulvany on this and on every other occasion, and proclaimed our belief to our readers, as an inducement to their taking early advantage of the scheme afforded them of improving their properties, alleviating the distress of the people, and ultimately adding to the national strength. Time went quickly on, but the improvement slowly; and amongst the many excuses given by the defenders of the government and Board of Works, for the snail's pace at which they are travelling, was one, that they could not get engineers. .Alas! for the country, such is not the case; for, if we are not much mistaken, they have too many of that so-called class."
"As we never wished to assert anything we are not prepared to prove, we will give one example to show that our information, obtained from Mr. Mulvany, was not to be relied upon, or, otherwise, that his officers are retarding the work he has so anxiously and so ably undertaken, In the barony of Ikeathy, in the county of Kildare several meetings of the gentry, and many of cess-payers took place to consider how the people could be employed and kept from starvation. It was at length resolved on, to memorial the Lord Lieutenant to call an extraordinary presentment"
"O  sessions, which took place on Monday the 23d inst. at the petty sessions’ house at Donadea. The magistrates present were Sir Gerald G. Aylmer, Bart., Sir William Hart, Bart., the Honourable Edward Lawless. Captain Aylmer, ?. Coates, Esq., ?. Kearney, Esq., &c., with many of the highly respectable cess-payers who reside in this Barony. There also attended the county surveyor, Mr. Yeates, who is reputed to be a superior engineer, an upright man, and we know, of our own knowledge, a gentleman of great practical intelligence. There attended, on the part of the government, a very elegant and accomplished young gentleman, named, as far as we could learn, Captain or Mr. Brandy. The number of the unemployed men in the barony having been ascertained to be 212, it was resolved to vote a sum of something over £2,000, or one 15th of the entire valuation of the barony, to employ them for three months. The Hon. Edward Lawless, in that spirit which characterises all his actions, so well worthy the son of Lord Cloncurry, patriotically and philosophically pressed on the meeting the necessity of employing the people, so few in number compared to other places of distress, without taxing the property of the barony to an enormous amount, to support a staff of government officers, and in doing so, put a very legitimate question to the officer in attendance—namely, what amount of the taxation should go to the officers ? The gentleman replied, ""Oh, a mere trifle; about one-seventh. Remembering Mr. Mulvany's answer to ourselves, and being determined to test this gentleman's authority for stating ""one-seventh,"" we gave the answer as Mr. Mulvany gave it to us, and as we have before given to the public. The young gentleman replied—""The Board of Works have a great objection to allow stewards to drain land under them, believing they do not under- stand such work."" Indignant at such an assumption, we told him what we now repeat for his information and that of the Board of Works, but more especially for the information of the landed proprietors, whose property is at stake, that there are hundreds of stewards in Ireland at the present time who understand the practical, effectual, and economical draining of land better than any one of the juvenile so- called engineers; and we again call on the landed proprietors to protect their properties from being swallowed up by such a staff. Just, gentle reader, for a moment think of £14 or £15 sterling being swallowed up by those gentlemen out of every hundred pounds that must come out of the people's pocket to feed the starving population; and; when we say £14 or £15 out of every hundred pounds we have no guarantee that the amount to be so swallowed up may not be twice or thrice that sum. In addition to which, the useless expenditure of money by these inexperienced young or o/d men (we care not whether they be young or old, when we know they are inexperienced) will, in many cases, be 100 percent. higher than it need be; nay, there will be money spent in profusion on land that in all probability does not require draining at all, except in as far as it will enable speculators to drain the unfortunate proprietor's purse, and send himself and his posterity to beggary."
"Well, if this should happen, with all the warnings they have got, and will continue to get, they will in some measure deserve more opprobrium than is endeavoured to be cast on them by much, and the most powerful, part of the press. It may be asked how can they prevent it ? We answer, very simply. Let them not take the mere word of any one of these would-be agricultural engineers. Let them remember the following amongst the other instructions of the Board of Works :—"
"""The specification should contain a full and clear description of the works proposed to be executed, stating the dimensions of each, the materials to be used, the order"
"382  of proceeding with the works, the distance between the parallel or minor drains in the different kinds of soil or different parts of lands to be drained; and it will be advisable that such other particulars be stated as shall be fully sufficient for the guidance of the persons employed, on the part of the owners, to execute the works, and for the officers _of the commissioners appointed to inspect their execution; so that, as far as practicable, all disputes or difference of opinion as to the nature, extent, or dimensions of the works to be executed shall be avoided."""
"lf we can understand plain English and common sense we would say, it is, by the above, expressly understood, that the proprietor has the legitimate right to select his on officers, to report on the necessity and advantage of such works, and also to superintend and direct their execution, And that the Board of Works has also the right of inspection of the same when done; and this is what Mr. Mulvaney so kindly told us already, as we have already told the public. Yet in the face of all this we are to be told by a young gentleman who, perhaps, never drained or judiciously sub-soiled an acre of ground in his life, that the Board have an objection to stewards draining their employers properties, - men who have been draining their whole lives, and whose practical profession it undoubtedly is, and whose professional existence depends on their success in enforcing economy in the judicious execution of such works."
"The Board of Works could never contemplate such a confiscation of property as must ultimately take place, if proprietors must place their properties under the tender mercies of striplings; and perhaps this may be one of the reasons why such works are not going more extensively on— that proprietors justly dread the ruin that stares them in the face if they hand over their properties to the carving of these gentry. Let us once more implore of the landed proprietors to be on their guard, and when an extraordinary presentment sessions is about to take place in their neghbourhood, to bear in mind the instructions of the Board of Works, and to bring with them to such meetings their steward*, or their neighbours’ stewards, or at all events some men of practical experience, whose presence will render it hazardous for these young gentlemen to exceed their instructions, or at least to violate the public instructions of the Board of Works,"
"The thanks of the country are due the Hon. Edward Lawless; for were it not for his question put the other day at the meeting in the barony of Ikeathy, the undercurrent influence of these itinerant so-called engineers would undermine a good deal of the property of the country, and keep the people in actual starvation, whilst their object would be to secure jobs for themselves, in the hope that when the property of the country would be about to change hands they would come in for the lion's share."
"WE beg to call attention to two very important letters from W. Blacker, Esq., which will be found in another part of to-day's paper, addressed to the members of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland, relative to the deplorable state of the country. Independently of our having, as we hope, the honor of using Mr. Blacker's excellent letters, as all his invariably are, wheresoever found, as a member of the same society, we, as a member of the press, avail ourselves of the privilege of doing so."
"To everything Mr. Blacker has written on the subject, with one exception, we cheerfully subscribe, as far as we are competent to judge of his views. Indeed, we"
O  have over and over given expression to many of them ourselves.
"The only point in which we differ from Mr. Blacker, is as regards the withholding of the money to be paid for draining until the work is finished; and our reason for this difference will be to many very easily understood. It is simply this: Few landlords have money to spare or to spend for such purposes, and, consequently, could not afford to undertake the work, if not at once afforded the means of obtaining money to do so. Yet, in giving this opinion, we are open to the correction of Mr. Blacker."
"We, as a member of the Royal Agricultural Society of Ireland, beg to join Mr. Blacker in requesting that the landed proprietors will press on the government to call parliament to assemble and enact such or somewhat similar simple laws as Mr. Blacker shows the frightful necessity of, to arrest the ruin with which the country is threatened — nay, already suffering under."

ROYAL DUBLIN SOCIETY'S SECTIONAL MEETING MR COOPER'S SCIENTIFIC PAPER ON THE CAUSE OF THE LATE POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, November 28"", 1846, page 489-490"
"As every additional information, whether purely practical or merely hypothetical, connected with the cause of failure in the late potato crop, will be received with such credence as each in his limited or extended capacity may be disposed to award to it, and as most people, if not all, are still as much in the dark regarding the true cause of the disease itself during its work of destruction —and although we cannot add a spark to the many illuminations that form a halo round this dark plaguy spot, we cannot but again offer our grateful acknowledgments to the Royal Dublin Society for the rich, scientific treat afforded us and the public on last Saturday evening, at one of their sectional meetings, at which a paper had been read by that highly enlightened and industrious philosopher, Mr. Cooper, of Markree, in the county of Sligo. The sectional meeting took place at 8 o'clock, p.m., in the Council-room of the Society's house, Kildare-street. There were upwards of two hundred highly respectable, and in the majority, scientific and practical gentlemen from the different parts of Ireland present, and with the approbation, we might say, amidst the acclamation of all, Sir Edward Stanley, Knight, was called to the chair, who, in a short hut eloquent address, detailed the objectives of the meeting - open to all and for the benefit of all."
"In the absence of Mr. Cooper, one of the talented and eloquent secretaries, Mr. Foot; undertook to read Mr. Cooper's very scientific paper, and after prefacing it with some eloquent and appropriate remarks, did so in a most clear and distinct manner."
"The great length of the paper and depth of the subject render it out of our power to give it at full length, and to attempt condensing it would be but betraying our own ignorance, and perhaps what would be worse, betraying our readers into the hope of arriving at anything like a fair conclusion on this, of all others to Irishmen, most embarrassing problem."
"384  The summing up may perhaps suffice those who are but little versed in speculative philosophy. Mr. Cooper concludes:— I offer the preceding facts and observations with great deference, being in no way an electrician myself, but should the result be enquiry on the part of those well informed on the subject, and the direction suggested for that enquiry should be found to be the correct one, I shall feel perfectly satisfied."
"I may first add, that with the opinion I hold, that the immediate cause of the potato disease is unusual tension of electricity in the atmosphere, whether by day or night, it is my intention to make an experiment upon a future crop, by having poles, with copper tractors attached to them, in the land, at various distances from one another, taking 64 to the English acre for the greatest number, leaving them 10 yards apart, and trying the experiment on others with a less number. Is it too much to hope for Mr. Cooper's great success, notwithstanding that many scientific and practical gentlemen expressed their dissent from Mr. Cooper's theory, amongst whom were Mr. Hogan, Dr. Davis, Mr. Moore, Professor Davy, Mr. Richard Dowden, &c., &c."
"We, too, would have offered a practical fact that amongst others came under our own observation, but we felt loath to add to the number of conflicting opinions we have heard expressed on this very perplexing question. This we will give on some future occasion, shall a fitting opportunity present itself, either in our own pages or elsewhere."

"THE ruinous expenditure of the public money, not only, in the making of unnecessary new roads, lowering hills that could without much inconvenience be suffered to exist, and adorning public roads of little interest as regards convenience, has been in itself, all all anticipated, bad enough; but the demoralizing influence exercised by drawing off the labourers from, their more legitimate employment, whilst it but aggravated the evils as regards the farming community generally, and tended to convert the once industrious poor cottier tenant into an idler and a vagrant, had been so well anticipated, and clearly shown by many philantropic gentlemen long since, that little need for can now said in confirmation of such impressions beyond a mere reiteration of what has been already said and written on the subject. To obviate this evil or rather combination of evils, many gentlemen in their private capacities, as members of relief committees, and as poor law- guardians, have agreed to a voluntary taxation in which many of the neighbouring farmers cordially joined, whilst others through various motives, some, perhaps, selfish, and others foreseeing the futility of such attempts to ward off as temporary that which they knew would, unfortunately, be of long standing, knowing; full well,"
"like skilful doctors, that the longer a desperate disease is allowed to lurk in the ."
"system, the more desperate must be the remedy in arresting its progress. The social disease of Ireland,- rendered desperate this unfortunate year, which should"
"O  have been met when the desperation of its condition was first pointed out, is penetrating into the very vitals of society, and such portions of it as will not utterly have been destroyed this year, will have become affected with a gangrene that years of the most skilful treatment, admitting the possible endurance of the suffering patient, will not remove.."
"Skilful and experienced surgical practitioners cut deeply, and at once, into the healthy portion of the system to arrest the insidious ramifications of the cancers extreme fibers, regardless of the first, regardless of the first feelings of the patient, _ whilst the more nervous medical practioner, out of tenderness for the patients nervous sensibility, may rest satisfied with applying gentle aperients, or mere cauteries, as if for a cutanious infection, that will do little more than deceive the surgeon-general when called on, when the patient is reported to be in the last stages of convulsive spasmodic or putrefactive existence. Such is the state of society that Ireland is bordering on at the present moment. Yet many kind-hearted, excellent men had, up to a late period, been led to believe that by taxing themselves, many of them far beyond their abilities, to afford a temporary employment for the poor people, they might arrest the calamity, whilst their more wealthy resident neighbours sat listlessly by without employing an individual beyond a shepherd and a couple of dogs on a thousand acres of land, or whilst their would-be more fashionable neighbour, who had contributed much to create the distress which they were beggaring themselves to remove, was spending his time and money far out of the hearing of the cries of the miserable creatures by whose toil and industry he was supported."
"The foregoing rough spun remarks are reluctantly forced upon us by events of a late occurrence that came under our observation, and by numerous letters which we are daily receiving, relative to the state of the country. We have forborne to take any part in discussing any subject that could tend to reflect discredit on any portion of the labouring population; in some places we know driven almost to desperation by the condition they are reduced to, notwithstanding that we know that in some places, although famine was staring them in the faces, distress would not nor could not prevail, were it not for the baleful influence of the so-called public works, either in operation, or in progress of being so. We last week promised a fact and the week before, endeavoured to pay a well merited compliment to the Hon. Edward Lawless, for his philantrophy in the barony of ikeathy, in the county of Kildare. We then studiously avoided including the names of other proprietors who had also a claim on our respect, and now take the liberty of using them with more effect and on a more befitting occasion. These are—Sir Gerald G. Aylmer, Bart, Sir Wm. Hort, Bart., .Coates, Esq., Kearney, Esq., John Aylmer, Esq., Gerald Aylmer, Esq., Christopher Wryad, Esq., and a host of other gentlemen and respectable farmers of the barony already mentioned, who had some time back assembled to ascertain the number of unemployed people in the barony, and to tax themselves by increased employment for their support. These gentlemen had previously an immense number of supernumerary labourers employed, whilst there were others holding lands in the same barony who had not an individual man employed, and who hold land that could be vastly improved by drainage and sub-soiling, by the expenditure of a little money on it, which they could well afford to employ in that way. Two meetings took place in this barony, at which we had the honor of attending professionally. We observed the great unanimity that prevailed amongst"
"386  the aforesaid gentlemen to ward off unnecessary taxation on their properties, and that of their neighbor, whilst at the same time save the labourers from distress, and preserve them from the contamination consequent on the associations of useless road making. Having ascertained the number of unemployed in the barony to be 212, each resolved to take a certain number—some forty, some thirty, and some down as far as each gentleman or farmer could conveniently employ."
"We were asked how many we would take, to which we replied, none. Objecting, as we did, to the principle as unjust to the gentlemen who had already given so much employment to be saddled with so many more, whilst their equally wealthy, but less charitable, neighbours were exempt from their just share of the burden; and we objected to it, secondly, from believing it would rather aggravate the evil, as work would not be done as an equivalent for the monies so paid; and, thirdly, that when such temporary employment would cease—as we well know it would—the people unemployed would be greater in number than at that time, as many then who were farmers, living on the produce of their little spot, would be paupers in three months time; and after giving this premonitory warning, and knowing it was but an experiment, we resolved on joining in it to give it a fair trial. We accordingly agreed to take ten men, and, at once, laid out task work for them, leaving a competent person to superintend its execution. The work was sub-soiling land that had been an old garden, but some lying under grass."
"We laid o ut wage 50 per cent, higher than should be paid for such work in any part of Ireland—namely, one shilling and sixpence per square perch, or £12 per acre for trenching land 18 inches deep. When the men assembled they at once refused the task-work, even at this high price; but, being anxious to employ them, we gave orders to proceed with the work and gave them one shilling a day, in the hope they would soon see the advantage of taking the task-work; and if not that, at worst, they would be supported until the time appointed for holding the next meeting, which was in a fortnight afterwards. We then went out to attend the meeting and inspect the work, which, to our utter surprise, had cost, with labour at one shilling a day, the ruinous sum of £17 10s. par acre."
"Thinking that a gross injustice towards the proprietors to keep down starvation, whilst others were escaping without any expense we offered them he following rates of wages which we think high enough (if not, we beg to be corrected,) namely, Is. Per perch, or £8 per acre, for trenching such land 18 inches deep; 9d. per perch, or £6 per acre, for sub-soiling such land at 15 inches deep; and 6d. per perch, or £4 per acre, for merely digging land, to fit it for a crop of wheat, 12 inches deep; and, in addition, that they might employ their children, and others unsuited for heavy labour, and as an encouragement to get the work well done, we offered to give 3d. per ton for all the stones they would raise and collect during the operations of trenching, sub-soiling, or digging."
"Each and every one of these terms they promptly refused, and, as in duty bound, we then discharged them, to get employment at the public work's, believing that the property we had them employed on would escape better by being taxed with its share of the amount levied under the labour rate act, even if the tax should amount to as high a sum as the rental, than be compelled, by voluntary assessment, to pay over one hundred per cent, more for manual labour than such"
"O  labour in any part of Ireland, even in the vegetable gardens about Dublin, would be value for."
"We are, and always have been, advocates for a fair day's wages for a fair day's work, knowing that ""the labourer is worthy of his hire;"" but in being so, we know also that a fair day's work should be expected for a fair day's wages: and if that be not had, agricultural labour must be suspended until all are taught, and made to understand, the value of labour, and that all will feel the necessity of attending to the proper direction of it."
"To enumerate the evils which are flowing, and of which few have little conception, will hereafter appear as a consequence of protracted legislation, would occupy, week after week, the entire of our columns, even were they larger than they are."
"We knew that things would come to this, and we offered our warning voice against them. We knew more — we knew that things will be in a much worse state before twelve months pass over us, than many people, even in the present alarming state of the country, can anticipate. We foretold that the mutual distrust that existed between the labourer and farmer, the farmer and middleman, the middleman and head landlord, would, on this desperate emergency, as by some fatal stroke, produce such confusion, that all should suffer, not only for their own faults, but the faults of others. We knew, and have foretold, that the labourer would, in a spirit of self-approving retributive justice, take advantage of the farmer's condition, and cease to give value even for the scanty wages niggardly dealt out; that many farmers would cry out ""wolf before the animal made is appearance, as a pretext to evade paying his rent — as a punishment, whether well or ill-merited, by the landlord; and that in the end the landlord would be the greatest sufferer, and that the innocent would suffer with the guilty. We warned them early enough to enable them to insist on getting provisions into the country, or to keep in it those they had, and to get parliament together, or rather, keep the parliament sitting until simple and efficient laws should be enacted to protect the lives of the people, and the property of the country. We warned them — we were the first to do so — of the loss of the potato; and we were the first to warn them of what provision- monopolists would do, when they would have the ball at their own foot. Time has proved, alas, that our forebodings were well founded — that the small farmer who could, by a timely application of a suitable remedy to his especial case, have been made the mainstay of the country, as a balance of power in the social state, instead of which he has been permitted to waste and consume his little stock without paying his rent, as he could have done, if protected; but instead of that, he is now a labourer, a pauper: his little farm lying waste whilst he is adding to the number who are crying out for food and employment at the miserable property-destroying, life-destroying — we had almost said, soul destroying monster, public works."
388  SUSPENSION OF PUBLIC WORKS
"Farmers Gazette, December 19° 1846, pages 521-522"
"The following document has appeared in some of the morning papers, and of course every one will read and construe it according to his taste, prejudice, or partiality:"
DRAINAGE ACT—IRELAND. CIRCULAR NO. 38.
"The employment of the destitute on roads and other public works must soon terminate, and reproductive works be substituted for them. To render such works really beneficial and morally useful, the landed proprietors must join hand in hand with the Board of Works.-Every proprietor or farmer will be interested in the practical success of some local work, and as the number will be great, the success will be in proportion to the zealous co-operation which the board may receive."
"Works connected with thorough draining and sub-soiling with the spade, must be executed systematically and calmly—no external force, no hurry, can be admitted. The number of labourers required for each particular work can be accurately known, and each individual labourer should have a task allotted to him, say, sufficient for a fortnight or three weeks."
"To enable each labourer to till his own farm, or that of a neighbouring farmer, and at the same time earn the support of his family through employment on drainage works, it is proposed that the task to be allotted to each labourer should consist of a certain length of drain, and the collection and breaking of stones for the drain; where the stones are to be gathered from the same or neighbouring fields, the children of the labourer may be employed by him in collecting them into heaps, and if sufficiently near, depositing them on the side of the drain cut by the father."
"If, with the assistance of his children, the task, sufficient for a fortnight, be completed in six or eight days, the labourer will receive his money, and be at liberty to devote the remainder of the fortnight to farm labour, and still will have earned sufficient to support his family until the time arrives for commencing a second task, and so on."
"To render the drainage works substantially beneficial to the landed proprietors, it is necessary that the most approved system of thorough draining should be adopted."
"To effect this object-, the commissioners of public works , mean to appoint district inspectors of drainage, whose duty will be, in the first instance, to examine the site of every work presented for; to determine the extent of land to be drained, and mark its boundaries on the ordnance plans; to lay out the works connected with the ‘main or open drains; to determine the depth and all the details belonging to the covered drains; to estimate the cost of the drainage per acre; to value the land in its present state and give his opinion as to the increased value which will result from the drainage; and report on the whole to the commissioners."
"of  During the time occupied by the inspector of drainage in the performance of this duty, the landed proprietor, the agent, or steward, should attend for the purpose of receiving instructions as to the particular works to be executed in each case, and should recommend suitable persons who may be employed as local overseers to carry them out."
"The stewards or farmers, as the case may be, to act without salary: but the local overseers recommended by them, when approved of by the inspector of drainage, will be paid according to their qualifications and exertions."
"The sanction of the Treasury having been received for the drainage works of any district, and the number of labourers to be employed in each determined, on due notice being given to the Relief Inspecting Officers of the Board of Works, he will name labourers for each from the list of the destitute residing within the electoral division or barony, as is usual for the road works; and it is expected that the landed proprietors, farmers, and stewards connected with each work will use every exertion to scrutinize the list of the destitute, to insure that none who have other means of support be employed. The land will be assessed for the expenditure, and consequently the admission of persons not requiring relief, by adding to the number, will proportionally increase the assessment; hence it becomes the interest as well as the duty of all cess-payers to limit the admission of labourers to those who are wholly destitute. By order,"
"Jos. C. WALKER, Secretary, Board of Public Works, 9th day of Dec. 1846."
"Landlords of Ireland, what does that letter mean, beyond this, that all the employment of the people on public works must soon terminate? and that utter destitution must immediately follow, except reproductive works be substituted, to give employment to the people. The term, reproductive works, sounds very well, but according as the law now stands, and circumstanced as you are, we ask in what manner can works be made ""re-productive"" of anything really beneficial to the country, except the total annihilation, of the present landlord class can be considered so. You are told you ""must join hand in hand with the Board of Works."" To do what ? Simply, what neither you nor the Board of Works have the power to do, as you all well know, or at least ought to know. You are told, that ""every proprietor, or farmer, will be interested in the practical success of some local work."" This, we believe, you need scarcely be told; but you are told that ""as the number will be great, the success will, be in proportion to the zealous co- operation which the Board may receive."" ""The number"" of what? Is it of proprietors, or farmers, or labourers, or of all ? The document does not say, nor does it matter the Board much, provided you ""join hand in hand"" with it."
"Landlords of Ireland, beware of "" the union of the shark with his prey.""* The Board of Works have not the power, nor can your uniting with them "" hand in hand"" confer that power on them, to do even-handed justice to your property and the country, unless you and they can be first armed with a stronger power than any existing law affords you. Beware of that. Beware of playing a game now that will ensure to you the curses of your posterity."
"390  Your property is still comparatively safe. To keep it in that state is in your power ; nay, it is in your power to render it more secure in three months than the most sanguine improver amongst you could nine months ago calculate on having it, as‘matters formerly went on, in the next three hundred years. Will you let slip tile opportunity, not of joining "" hand in hand"" with the Board of Works, but of joining “hand in hand"" with one another. Do that now, for now is the time. Remember there is a ""tide in men's affairs"" which, if made-a proper use of when at its height, will place you high and dry in your just possessions; but let that tide once begin to ebb, and your property will been gulphed in the chaos of ruin to which its receding breakers will rapidly hurry it. In the name of all that is dear to you here and hereaiter let not slip the golden opportunity that is now presented to you. Bury in oblivion for once and for ever your past religious and political differences. Remember it was by your example in these respects your people have been set against each other, and against you. And remember it is by your example, of union and brotherly attach- ment to each other, you can set the people to think and act like men and Christians. We will return to this letter again, and discuss those other paragraphs that appear to have anything of a practical tendency, whether for good or evil. Nor can we conclude those hasty remarks without again warning you of the danger you are in, and imploring of you to make the most of the time between ‘this and the next meeting of parliament, and thereby be prepared to insist on justice being done you. You have the materials if you only make use of them."
"ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF IRELAND Farmers Gazette, December 19'"", 1846, page 522"
"The much talked of 14th rule of the above society is now again in force in its ""integrity."" There has been more noise made about this unhappy rule than it was ever worth, except in as far as it showed the inconsistency of having ever adopted it, as all must see who read the ""objects,"" contemplated in the formation of that society, some of the most valuable of which were never advanced one step, namely agricultural teaching."
"Perhaps the society never contemplated that object, although so prominently set forth. If not, far better would it have been never to have put it forth, in which case - the 14th rule would have been perfectly consistent. One thing is quite certain, the 14th rule renders agricultural teaching in the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland a dead /etter. But as this is the time to let ""bygones be bygones,’ the reinstating of the 14th rule has done one good — namely the bringing back of his Grace the Duke of Leinster to the position which it is his legitimate place to occupy, as president of the society; and the educational object has been virtually abandoned, which should be taken up elsewhere. The society is calculated to do, as it has already done, much good; and it is to be hoped that the other noblemen, whose conscientious convictions caused them to become ""seeders,"" will follow the good example set by the noble president, and by their aid and influence, give a new tone to the society ; and as this is a time, which of all others requires unity of action on the part of the agricultural ""improvers,"" it is to be hoped that every man who has it in his power to lend a helping- hand will be"

"AMIDST human miseries, greater, perhaps, than ever afflicted any Christian country in so short a time, we have arrived at the happy festival of the blessed nativity. Yes, there is a happiness even to the perishing, famine-stricken and plague- stricken dying parent to know, that there was born for him a Redeemer, whose sufferings could not, by any human being, be equalled; and that that Redeemer can protect the "" little ones,"" which, next to the dying man's heart's blood, is most painful to him to part. Nor is there in history a more striking proof of man's faithful belief in the promises of a divine Redeemer, than is exemplified in the resignation of the perishing Irish peasant, who, whilst his body is permitted to pollute the atmosphere, looks forward to an immortality for himself, and, in the fullness of time, for his bereaved offspring, that it is not in the power of governments or provision-merchants to give or withhold."
"Yes, this consolation is left the dying father, though stretched on the same loathsome litter with his equally afflicted wife and children, who have not the power to afford as much as a drop of water to his burning tongue; nay, to scare off the famishing rats, that will not await the last breathing, before they commence the destruction of the Redeemer's image."
"This, landlords of Ireland, is a faint but faithful sketch of the condition of your people, whom, through good and evil report, you and your ancestors have endeavoured, very many of you, to a degree beyond your means, to make happy. This is the period at which you were wont to relieve the distresses of your suffering neighbours and dependents, so as to enable them to enjoy the earthly happiness consequent on this returning season."
"Alas! the times are altered, sadly altered, for the jppe repuwd rich. W well a.s for tho universal;"
"poor. We will not attempt to harrow up feelings by calling to your recollections the happiness you and your people have heretofore enjoyed at this time of the rear. Oh ! no, it is of no use to do so, except in as far as we might venture to say that ihiap, bad as all must admit they arc at present, may iK made worse. It is now going on six months since we predicted, alas to truly, the state of things as they are at the present moment. Some few friends thought we were overstepping the boundary that should circumscribe us; but we knew that truth was mighty, and that it would prevail, and that it was only from those who were practically acquainted with the country, and who had no party feeling to indulge in, pandour to, or gratify, that such could be obtained. We will continue our predictions. Your cases will be still worse if you let slip the hold you still have."
"Read the treasury minutes lately issued; they are plausibly put forth, but beware of the poison contained in the honied draught. It would be an insult to your judgment"
"392  were we to attempt to show you where the danger lies in those baits, or feelers, so artfully thrown out or laid for you."
"Remember the government knew that famine would ensue in Ireland; they were told of it, and refused to supply provisions, but left the people to the tender mercies of the provision traders. Remember the provision merchants now have the power of life and death over the people; and remember that thousands will be left to perish, that the provision men may the more readily get hold of your property, when by famine cleared of the redundant population."
"The provision man, or more properly speaking the starvation man, has that power at the present moment all but ratified, and as if ashamed, or affecting shame at thie part acted by the government; and affecting sympathy with the people, some of them have turned round and complained, that out of some hundreds of shins at Odessa, where it appears corn is plenty, England had but ten or twelve of the number, and that cargoes were purchased for Ireland; but no vessels could be had to bring the corn over. Landlords of Ireland—you have a rightful claim on the"
"_ treasury of England, which is also the treasury of Ireland, for a more substantial instalment than a mere treasury minute, which would be but so much waste paper, except that as by throwing up a straw, it will show how the wind blows; you now see how the wind blows in that quarter, and beware that there is death and destruction of your property in the same wind: you cannot now enjoy the usual happiness of Christmas at home with your people, but you can usefully devote the time—-a short time it should be—till parliament meets. Meet, yourselves, in the meantime, not in twos or threes, in isolated places, such as Cork and Longford, respectable and important though they be, but meet simultaneously, and command the government to do something bordering on even handed justice to this ill-fated country. No government can refuse. The English nation, even apart from the noble and generous nature of her people, will not—they cannot refuse you, self- preservation being with them like other people, the first law of nature, will lead them at once to see that Ireland's ruin will be the precursor of England's downfall. But should England deny the right to participate in our misfortunes, and continue to sit majestically as mistress of all other nations—a position in which the wealth and blood of Irishmen have contributed to place her, she cannot deny such assistance, the more especially if it cost her nothing, as will enable you to make such simple laws as will render every species of property in Ireland justly liable to the support of the people, for without the people, all property must be as so much trash."
"There is no use in wasting your time in debating how you can remove mole or anthills whilst there are mountains to be passed over, nor in nibbling at candle ends and cheeseparing laws. Whatever laws you purpose having passed, let them be clear and defined. Don't permit the necessity of having a Lord Lieutenant here, after to break them; for remember you may not have a Lord Lieutenant possessing the courage and magnanimity to do so. Remember the parable of the bundles of sticks, and that, if united, success will bless your exertions; but if divided death, confiscation of property, and the eternal scorn of posterity, will be your just reward."
O  THE LATE POTATO DISEASE AND ITS CAUSE
"Farmers Gazette, December 26"""", 1846, pages 553-554"
"IT is considered by many people that out of evil then sometimes springs good; but by many more that at evil act should not be perpetrated, although that good might be expected to result from it ultimately."
"Out of the potato disease, great as the distress consequent on it has been felt and will be felt for years to come it has opened up sources from which good will flow to an unprecedented degree to those who may live to see their results without having suffered previously to a degree beyond what they could with justice bear."
"One, out of many, of the great advantages likely to be derived from the late disease, is the difficulty that will be experienced in speculative theorists getting the heads of the people to swallow every wild theory that even the best of men may conceive likely to become fascinating or fashionable. The cause of the potato dis- ease is a mystery; and likely to remain so. We do not mean to say that no one has happened to point out the real cause: but this much we know, that no one has, as yet—within our knowledge, at least—pointed out any means by which such disease can be arrested, amongst all the specifics given to the world, and of which the world must now be heartily sick."
"We are led to make these remarks by having our attention called to a letter in the Impartial Reporter, or Fermanagh Farmer's Journal. This letter is written by Mr. John Arthur, who has been weighing ""the atmosphere and waiter, both in wet and dry weather,"" and found, it appears from his letter, ""free oxygen to a much greater degree "" last season ""than in ordinary seasons;"" and attributes the disease of the potato to the power possessed by oxygen to conduct electricity, as he says all acids ""are conductors."" Well, if all acids are conductors—and it does not matter our practical readers in this case whether they are or are not—how is it we are to guard against their effects in conducting electricity when the atmosphere is surcharged with it, if that time should even become sufficiently known, and what are the means attainable for practical purposes? Mr. Arthur suggests the early planting in, and the application of ""chalk (carbonate of lime) coal-ashes, and lime that had been a long time slaked."" That the early planting affords chances of success is now almost universally admitted; but whether chalk, coal-ashes, or ""lime, a long time slaked,” will have any extraordinary chemical effect, we are not quite prepared to admit or disprove: but this much we think, they may be all useful for mechanical purposes, in superinducing early maturity, but that they possess the power either chemically or mechanically to protect the crop, if disease similar to that experienced last season sets in this season, we totally deny—and here is one of our proofs: Amongst a variety of experiments tried by us last season—of which the world knows nothing, nor does it matter the world, as they were all unsuccessful— we tried the following:— We planted potatoes in coal-ashes, chalk, and in lime ""a long time slaked,” and in lime not ""a long time slaked;"" in charcoal from wood, from peat, and in sawdust without being charred; in sea sand, and in river sand (from the Liffey); in bank gravel, in pure peat without gravel, and in peat and shell gravel mixed ; we planted in February, March, April, May, and June, both in the above"
"394  ingredients, and in a deep, rich loam; some with guano, some with bonedust, prepared in a variety of ways; some with farm-yard manure, and some in the common mould without any manure; and the result of our experiments proved to be merely this, that those planted earliest produced the most forward crop, but when the disease became general even these forward tubers did not remain proof against its fatal effects; and the reason we notice this paper at all is, to caution our readers against trusting to any nostrum, no matter how respectable the vender may be, if he cannot, by successful practice, point out the scene and seat of such practice, and then be able to give proof positive of what he states to be founded on fact instead of scientific imaginings, no matter how plausibly put forth."
OBSERVATIONS ON POTATO PLANTING
"Farmers Gazette, December 26, 1846, page 554"
"SIR — From the numerous concurrent evidences which have been advanced latterly by practical men, in favour of early potato planting, and the well-known facts all accustomed with the habits of that root are acquainted with, regarding the ill treatment it has been hitherto obliged to undergo from the early period of digging —say November, until the following May, or perhaps June, tossing about from pit to pit, and from house to house, exposed, perhaps, amidst all this, to severe winds, and, it may be, pinching frosts, added to a denudation of their young germs or buds two or three times during the acts of transposition. From such an array of arguments, I say no one of common sense will, in future, hesitate to confer his earliest and most particular attention upon the management of the crop in question. It has been, and, no doubt, will again be, and that ere long, a most invaluable crop. Were it to disappear from amongst us entirely (quo Deus advocat), no substitute could be found in any individual product,nor even in a combination of products for some time at least."
"The present loss has thrown a damper upon the exertions, the struggles, of all classes. See the confusion, the disorganization, but, worse than all, the destitution that it has caused. Every interest, from that of the crown down to the dung heap, that used to exist before the poor man's door — no very eligible situation, I grant, for the same commodity — is affected. It is by taking-such a view of the case as this, we shall, form some kind of an adequate idea of the disaster. The poor are starving — the somewhat better classes look upon their property as insecure — the landlords are struggling for their rents, whilst the government have a right to feel themselves no less uneasy on the occasion. With what ease the Almighty can accomplish such destruction? and cannot the same power that has produced all these changes, avert the most calamitous visitation? It is, therefore, to be anxiously hoped, that such a blessing is in store for us."
"Although, however, the work of destruction may have been partially accelerated in some instances by neglect of more or less salvatory precautions, we have no reason to presume that a similar amount of neglect could have been manifested in every country in which the potato crop has suffered. The whole affair baffles"
"O  fungical science, electrical lore, human skill; certain it is, however, as has been already premised, that early planting may, and will, prove the most effectual means of escaping the blight; and fortunate it is that the remedy is so simple and easily applied. Great caution in planting will be required to be exercised so as to insure the safety of the seed, and, consequently, the future crops. It is to be feared that few will make the experiment at all this year, apprehensive that it may end in disappointment. I could not, indeed, vouch for the security of such as have not been as yet put down; for whoever has observed the few healthy potatoes that were fortunately rescued from disease, cannot fail to have witnessed the rapidity with which they are pushing forth young shoots. Now, it were well, had this been taken advantage of sufficiently early, and the potatoes been consigned to their last resting-place, the latter having been first thoroughly prepared for their reception. It is to be desired that those potatoes in Dublin and elsewhere, which have been imported this season, be carefully handled, and kept from growing prematurely. It is time, at all events, they were bought up by those who intend to make use of them as seed; for it is to be feared that they will not receive that careful and delicate treatment which their much-debilitated constitutions require. Let me not be misunderstood when I say, delicate treatment. Perhaps it were better to consult nature, or, rather, their nature, and if they are to be kept over, prefer a situation, or medium, somewhat of the same temperature as the soil. Here they will not be so liable to spoil. No more wasteful or injurious situation could be chosen than a loft or boarded floor. It is entirely out of character with what should be the intention of the grower. A cool, but not too damp a medium, is decidedly to be preferred."
"In planting, the sets should not be cut, but the most plump and best-formed tubers selected, and the refuse, or unshapely ones, either used at table, or given to some of the animals. No practice connected with the cultivation of the potato is more to be recommended than that of digging or ploughing in the manure as soon as a sufficiency of it is collected. The indiscriminate use of powdered lime can also be strongly urged. Some may say, this does no good. Well, I say in reply, that it is more likely to do good than harm."
"Yours, &c., SIR WALTER RALEIGH, December 16, 1846."
"THE FAMINE Farmers Gazette, December 26"", 1846, page 555"
"As much has already been written and said as to the famine that has now fairly set in Ireland, that to be a worn out subject. Unhappily,however, it is that kind of a subject that will force itself on the public, and must be attended to, or it is easy to see what the consequences will be. The constant recurrence of coroners inquests on cases of death from starvation near the habitation of persons and their becoming familiar from frequent repetitions will be dreadful; on the other hand, outbreak and destruction of life and property from desperation, must be guarded against. is there, then, any other way to meet either or both these awful results, but by feeding the people ? to do which, in my humble judgment, it will, in the present state of things, require one of two things—either the particular interposition of Providence, in the shape of miracles; or the allHOSt"
"396  superhuman wisdom and energy of those who have means, to stay the calamity."
"There appears now a very general desire that an efficient independent central committee should be formed in Dublin. I made an ineffectual effort to accomplish this in the month of August last, and great public good might have been attained had the effort been successful. I shall now make another to facilitate the formation of such a body, which, it is to be hoped, will be composed of men with willing hearts, heads, and hands to co-operate with the government, and the different classes dis- posed to assist in bringing our beloved country through the dreadful ordeal which we are all called on now to bear a part in averting or mitigating —"

EMPLOYMENT OF THE PEOPLE
"Farmers Gazette, December 26"", 1846, page 555"
"siR—Your correspondent ""Looker on,"" has made some remarks upon my letter which appeared in your Gazette of the 5th inst. He considers me mistaken in supposing that Mr. Blacker agrees with me in preferring townland taxation to electoral division taxation. I have not the means before me at this moment of ascertaining that fact; nobody ought to read any communication from that most useful Irishman, carelessly, if I did so, I am sorry for it. As to the merits of the question, I adhere to the principle advocated in my former letter. I consider that taxation by townland is preferable to that by electoral divisions, because the enterprising and improving landlord will be thereby less hampered by the want of co- operation on the part of neighbouring proprietors, who may object to tax their pro- perties for drainage and the other permanent improvements, as he is willing to do; and because if he is thus enabled to support the population on his own townlands, he will be (as he ought to be) exempt from taxation upon the rest of the electoral division. I never said this arrangement could be effected without ""new legislation,” on the contrary, my expression was—""this improvement in the act, I take the liberty of expressing my conviction, that the legislature will consent to."" I have not leisure now to discuss the question, but I confess I see little force in the objections brought against it by “Looker on’."
"He rather overrates in my opinion the practical difficulties which will have to be encountered in draining land, under the system adopted by the Board of Works; and as soon as he reads the instructions for carrying out this important measure, he will perceive that by very judicious clauses; the interests of proprietors and tenants will be consulted, and their co-operation for the proper execution of the work secured. This will do away with the remainder of ""Looker-on's"" objections. With regard to Mr. Blacker's plan, I never intended to advocate any general plan for the improvement of Ireland by drainage and other agricultural improvements, in"
"O  contra-distinction to his. This is too important a subject to be disposed of in the space of a letter. The principle of "" bringing productive employment to the door of every poor man"" must be the most ardent desire of every one of us who has at heart the welfare of his country. But the question now to be considered is, how we can best effect the two-fold object of supporting the destitute population by means of funds liberally placed at our disposal for that special object by the government, and at the same time afford that support in such a way as will render the lands which will have to repay the advances, more capable of doing so. If we can combine these two objects, with that of stimulating the industry of the small farmer by ""bringing employment to his own door, and enabling, not only the man himself, but also his wife and children, to assist in different parts of the work,"" it will be a delightful consummation and I for one, hope we can, at least in certain localities, under the instructions issued by the Board of 'Works. In the electoral division, with which I am concerned, and which fortunately almost entirely belongs to one pro- prietor, our Belief Committee have accurate lists of the persons in need of employment, and have, in no instance that they can detect, allowed an individual to be employed on the Public Works, as long as one poorer could be found in need of such employment. We, however, during the exercise of these functions of our office, and the necessary investigation which it required, have had painful proof that many of the small farmers by the loss of their potato crop, are removed, only by a narrow, a very narrow interval from the class of destitute persons, and some are in that class, and we have been obliged to find support for them as such upon the Public Works. Whenever the drainage is in operation, there will be ample employment for every family in this electoral division needing it; for, in order to execute the amouni of drainage applied for in this electoral division, it will be necessary very greatly to increase the working lists, and we of the Relief Committee, -will find it our pleasant duty to recommend for employment in draining his own ground, many a small farmer, who has hitherto not received a farthing of public money to to assist him in struggling through this dreary season. This poor man will be allowed to contract for the opening of the drains on his own little farm — will have his wife and children to assist in different parts of the work in gathering stones, covering the drains, &c.,"" and if "" Looker on"" happens to pass the way, I hope he may agree in thinking it a pleasant sight, and that he will rejoice at seeing his own predictions not verified. As far as I have had time to examine the instructions published by the Board of Works, they are in my humble opinion very judicious ; and though you have, Mr. Editor, in terms rather flattering, alluded to my personal qualifications and influence, I have a strong conviction that by zeal, energy, and system, |, and those who are co-operating with me in this electoral division, will be able to prove that they can be acted on with benefit both to the payer and the paid—"
"Yours &c,. X. Y. Z."
"[Would to Providence that all our little differences of opinion, could be so easily reconciled as those of ""X. Y. Z.,"" Mr. Blacker, and ""A Looker On;"" and did Ireland possess a sufficient number of such names as ""X. Y'.

"398  -TO LORD JOHN RUSSELL Farmers Gazette, January 9°"", 1847, page 582"
"MY LORD—That the potato crop is completely gone, cannot now be denied. The bill introduced by your lordship to meet the calamity proposes, as I take it (for no copy that I am aware of has as yet reached this country), an advance of money for public works in the several baronies to be repaid by instalments with interest within a term of ten years—and to be leviable according to the poor law valuation."
"The urgency of the case, and the late period of the session, caused the bill to be hurried through both Houses, -and precluded the generality of Irish proprietors from being aware of the nature, or offering any suggestions, or observations, on its provisions previous to its becoming a law."
"As to its effects upon proprietors, there is but one opinion, they are all to be taxed heavily, but not equally, for some works, that may give at some remote period, a small return to a very few, and other works, that will yield no return at any period, to the many. I shall not stop, my lord, to discuss the proposition of each townland being compelled to support its own poor. The arguments used by the proprietors of rich pasture lands, with little or no population, asserting the hardship of compelling them to aid in supporting the numerous cottier population of their neighbours—and the arguments of the latter, alleging the hardship it would be, at such a period as the present, to exempt those rich lands, on which, either the cottiers would not be allowed to settle, or from which they were driven to the poorer lands, from contributing to the general support, though each having their due weight, are now beside the question I mean to discuss."
"That the bringing of large masses together, should as much as possible be avoided is a point that will be conceded—that there was little comparative value ob- tained for the money expended on public works this past season, will also be conceded, and that this small return of works has arisen chiefly, from the great num- bers who crowded in, to obtain employment, and which upset all system and order, will, I believe, be also admitted."
"That those who of necessity must now seek employment, will at least treble those who sought it last year is certain, and that the period for which the employment must be found will be for 11 instead of 3 or 4 months is equally certain."
"Except the immediate employment he obtains, the labourer on the public works receives no other, or after benefit; or if he do, it is of a very trifling or remote nature."
"The distance many are forced to come to the works is very long, and the inconvenience in obtaining their meals consequently very great; and should the labourer separate himself from his family, and take a lodging near the works, his lodgings and diet run away with the greater part of his earnings."
"For all these reasons, and because public works, however numerous and"
"©  extensive, cannot at this crisis afford satisfactory and remunerative employment, (for the cottier, and even the better class of small farmers must become labourers while this calamity presses in order to save their little capital from being swallowed up in their support), I would suggest that an inducement or bonus should be held out to proprietors, to give efs and cottiers, on their own holdings works or private works of proprietors for the mere labourer."
"I could name persons who had made, and others who were making arrangements of this nature, until your lordships plan was announced but immediately on its being known, the idea was abandoned, the proprietors said—we cannot afford to employ our Own numerous people who are in want, and also contribute to the support of those of others, as the baronial plan will compel us to do, and that on the heaviest scale, as we have several holdings rated under £5."
"What, I would presume to suggest, my lord, is, that as even in the event of private works being undertaken, public works must be laid out, and carried on, and to a considerable extent—that the labour, list, or register, on all public works, should specify the townland on which each labourer lived."
"That the surveyor in each county, with two engineers, one a civil, the other a military, men of experience and character, should be associated, and constitute a moving commission in each county, to report weekly on the progress of both public and private works, (on notice from proprietors), taking each barony in rotation—and that they should have a power to recommend that certain townlands should be -exempted from any charge, and others from portions of the charge, to which the proprietors were to become liable in consequence of the government advances."
"For instance, a townland of 500 acres rated at £500 per annum, under the Poor Law Valuation, with a population of 200 souls, and suppose the proprietor, either from his private funds, or having put the townland under the Drainage Act, (which, as I have not seen, I can only speak from hearsay) and to give such continued employment as to keep them all off the public works, would you not think it but just my Lord, to exempt that townland from contributing to the extra baronial cess? Not only that, but I would say, the proprietor ought to receive a further inducement, that of government reducing the rate of repayment for the drainage advance, from £6 10s. to £5 10s. per cent., and in every instance, in order to stimulate private enterprise, I would hold out a proportionate exemption to all proprietors giving employment."
"My Lord, the calamity with which the people is afflicted is an awful one. But awful though it may be, I do respectfully contend, that it may, (if your lordship will but take advantage of it) be turned into one of the greatest blessings that ever befel a country, situated as Ireland now is. We possess, my lord, a soil capable of vast improvement, not yielding more than one-third of what it might do, under proper management—almost the entire of the required improvement may be accomplished by manual labour, we possess the means of supplying this in abundance, and it only requires to be properly directed to give an immediate, and almost, four-fold return."
The entire of the peasantry are now in want of employment. Give it to them my
"400  lord—not through the medium of public works alone, but by the improvement of the land, letting, wherever it be possible, the labour be at the cottiers' own door, and on his own holding, and let public works be only an alternative where employment cannot be had on private works,"
"It was the late Mr. Jeykel, I believe, who said that the English court of Exchequer, in the year 1827, was composed of one who was a lawyer, but no gentleman; another who was a gentleman, but no lawyer; a third who was both a lawyer and gentlemen; and a fourth who was neither a lawer nor a gentleman."
"To apply this description to Irish proprietors, I would say that there are some who have the means but lack the inclination to improve their properties—some who have the inclination, but lack the means—some ho have both the means and the inclination—and others who have neither the means nor the inclination."
"It is in your power my lord, from the position which you hold at this present awful crisis, to turn the calamity with which it has pleased Providence to inflict us, into a blessing—you have the power to aid the needy, to stimulate the well disposed—and to compel the apathetic and reluctant to give present employment to a starving population, and which cannot fail to give a permanent good to the land, to the occupier, to the proprietor and to the state. ;"
"Let the Board of Works my lord select the improvements to be made, where there are tenants for life. Let tenants in fee select whatever description of improvement they please. Let the Board be the paymaster in all eases. Let your advances my lord, be liberal and on liberal terms, let them be the first charges on the several properties. Act boldly, my lord, and as the sufferings are already great, aye. very great, act promptly. I have the honour to be your lordship's obt. servant,"
"A LANDLORD LACKING THE MEANS, Co. Clare, Sept., 1846."
"The foregoing letter was written on the 10th of September last, it appeared in some of the provincial journals, Limerick Chronicle, Clare Journal, &c., &c., a few days after, when I took leave to forward a copy to your Lordship."
"That |, in common with many other Irish landlords, ""lack the means"" to carry out improvements to the extent we should wish (especially at the present time), I am quite free to confess."
"Four months have now elapsed, and I would respectfully ask, whether the"
employment of the people on public works has not tended to their demoralization?.
"Wheather the taxation has been heavy, and unequal; the works unproductive to"
"the many - beneficial to the few. Whether the employment, for which he required"
"payment in order to his support, was not needed by the coitier and the small"
"farmer, as well as by the mere labourer ?."
"Whether the unanimous voice of the most intellegent in the community has not been raised, almost unceasingly, in favour of employment on reproductive works, on the Townland plan?—and whether the policy, as well as the justice, of holding out a premium, instead of a penalty, to the enterprising and humane, has not been pressed upon the' authorities from every quarter? —_ Lastly, I would ask, whether"
"O  the calamity which four months ago was pronounced to be ""great, aye, very great,"" is not every day proving, and still likely to prove, of a more extensive and awful nature than the government could be induced to believe ?"
"The time that has been lost, and the habits which have been acquired by the peasantry during the period of ;heir employment on the public works, will, I fear, preclude your lordship from now realizing the hope I had entertained, of the calamity with which we were afflicted being turned into a permanent good ; for that the labour Act has signally failed—except in demoralizing the peasantry—ruining our roads— and placing aif Irish landlords (some in express trains) on the "" Road to Ruin,"" is now, I believe, admitted on all hands. Whether your lordship will propel the course by continuing to burthen them exclusively, in consequence of a visitation of Pro- vidence—or whether, having ascertained its magnitude, you will now, by treating the visitation as a NATIONAL calamity, arrest their process, remains to be seen—I lave the honour to be, your Lordship's obedient servant,"

GREAT MEETING OF IRISH LANDLORDS
"Farmers Gazette, January 16'"", 1847, page 595-598"
"The meeting of Irish Peers, Commoners, and landed proprietors, convened by the Productive Employment Committee, took place yesterday in the Long Room of the Rotudo, for the purpose, in the words of the circular issued by that committee, on considering the present alarming state of the country, and the measures which may be necessary to meet the crisis—such meeting to be confined exclusively to the consideration of the present social condition of this country, and all extraneous topics and party politics to be strictly excluded. In preparation for this meeting, the Produc- tive Committee had issued two sets of resolutions—the first referring to temporary, and the second to permanent remedial measures; and both were widely circulated amongst the landed proprietors. The issue of tickets for admission to the meeting commenced on Tuesday morning, and was continued until an advanced hour yesterday afternoon; but, nevertheless, so great was the influx of the gentry from the provinces that it became necessary to issue a further supply of tickets early in the forenoon. The time for commencing the proceedings was fixed for 12 o'clock, but, before that hour, a great number of landed proprietors were congregated in the Long Room, and soon after 12 o'clock it was crowded."
"The following list, prepared by the committee, comprises the names of those to whom tickets were issued; but there were many others in attendance who purchased tickets at the door:.— PEERS"
"The Marquis of Ormond, the Marquis of Sligo, the Marquis of Drogheda, the Earl of Erne, the Earl of Miltown, the Earl of Clonrael, Viscount Massarene, Lord Farnham, Lord Cloncurry, Lord Wallscourt, Lord Dunstaple, Lord Clarma, Lord Castlemaine, Viscount Suirdale."

"Captain Bernal Osborne, M.P., advanced to the table in front of the chair, where the Reporters were seated, and begged attention for a few moments. He would not, he said, at this early stage of the business of a meeting of such transcendant importance, have the presumption to introduce any proposition of his, unless in the way of suggestion; but whilst he felt it was a matter of duty towards the meeting itself to offer a suggestion, he should at once withdraw it, for the sake of unanimity, if the sense of the meeting appeared against him. When this meeting was first called, he believed it was convened upon the understanding that the landed proprietors should assemble"
"O  merely for the purpose of conversation and conference; but to him such a limitation of its objects seemed neither judicious nor desirable, and he thought they would not be carrying out their objects properly by excluding the public press from a meeting consisting of six hundred gentlemen (hear, hear). He (Mr. Osborne) believed that the press had been admitted sub rosa; but upon the understanding that the report previously to publication, should be submitted to the cognizance of the Productive Committee, and revised by them before going to the public (cries of no, no.) He submitted, with the utmost deference, that it would be most unwise to place any restrictions upon publicity, in"
"a case of such vast importance, The people of England,"
"with their strong prejudices, would be disposed to look with suspicion upon the proceedings of a meeting so conducted. They might apply to it the vulgar designation of “a hole and corner meeting,"" if the sentiments uttered by the gentlemen of Ireland, at such an emergency, were not given fully to the public. The object of his suggestion was, that the reports should be given in extenso; but, as he had said, if unanimity required it, he would waive his own objections, and he now left the matter to the good sense of the meeting (hear, hear.)"
The Chairman—Do you propose a resolution ?
"Mr. Osborne—No, my lord. I have confined myself to a friendly suggestion, and am not disposed to submit any motion; but I should be glad to hear the ground of objection upon the part of any gentleman of the committee."
"Mr. Monck, one of the honorary secretaries, referred to the course adopted by the committee, in order to show that the designation of ""a hole and corner meeting"" could not, by possibility, be applied to their proceedings, which were plain and open. The object of the meeting, as declared in the published circulars, was conference and discussion. Where such a vast number of gentlemen were congregated, there were, of course, many subjects upon which differences of opinion might naturally be expected, but which, upon consultation amongst themselves, might be arranged, and unanimity upon one great course of action thus secured (hear, hear). It would, he was convinced, be very undesirable that every word dropped in argument should be reported, because the exhibition of those unavoidable differences of opinion would present an example of want of unanimity (hear, hear). It was never contemplated to exclude the press altogether. On the contrary, tickets had been issued to the reporters of every Dublin journal, and to the correspondents of the London press and all those gentlemen had entered into the views of the committee to report substantially the business of the meeting (hear, hear)."
Mr. Osborne—My chief object was to prevent false or erroneous reports of the proceedings.
"Mr. Monck—The gentlemen of the press are at liberty to report generally, using their discretion as to unnecessary or unimportant details."
"Mr. Osborne—That fully attains my object, and I withdraw my suggestion (hear, hear.)"
"The noble Chairman here rose and said—I assure you, my lords and gentlemen,"
"406  that I have assumed this chair with hesitation, on seeing around so many others much better qualified by talent or position to occupy it. But the present emergency is so peculiar and so pressing that I conceive it is the duty of all men, no matter what may be their station or capacity, to do all that lies within their power for the good of their country (applause). And if, by the exercise of any influence I may possess, I can enable you to arrive at an unanimous determination as to the course to be pursued, I shall be most amply rewarded (hear, hear). This meeting, it strikes me, is quite peculiar in its constitution, and it has been, certainly, produced by circumstances enexampled in their character. We have here gentlemen of all shades of political opinion, meeting only as Irishmen, assembled only to advance Irish objects, and brought together solely to benefit their common couniry (hear, hear). So much depends upon unanimity of action that I am sanguine in the hope that every gentleman, in order to secure it, will be ready to put aside his own peculiar views, when they happen to be opposed to the general sense of the meeting. Let us bury the hatchet of political animosity for this day at all events (cheers). You are assembled in consequence of an unexampled state of affairs, to consider the most useful and practical remedies, and I shall not delay you by any comments of mine. The resolutions to be submitted to you have been prepared by a committee, comprising men of all shades of politics; but all differences have been cheerfully sacrificed to insure unanimity. It must be quite impossible, in a meeting of six hundred, to have unanimity as to details; but he trusted, so far as it was possible, that their proceedings would be characterised by unity of action. In conclusion, the noble chairman recommended that there should be as little discussion as possible, in order that the important business should be brought to a close in one day, and the country gentlemen be thus enabled to return to their respective residences at a time when their presence and active local exertion were so imperatively required (hear, hear)."
"Several letters of apology were then read, including letters from the Marquess Conyngham, Lord Glengall, Lord Kilmaine, the Hon. Frederick Shaw, Sir E. Hayes, Sir Gerald Aylmer, Grogan Morgan, Theophilis Nugent. Gen. Conyngham, James Hamilton. A. O'Connor, Conway Dobbs, J. Hyde, Castle Hyde; X,Wally, E. Smith, &c., highly approving of the proposed union of Irishmen, and of the general objects of the _ meeting."
"Sir Montague Chapman, Bart, rose and said—My lord, this very important meeting, as you are aware, has emanated from the Productive Employment Committee. I have ~ been deputed by that committee to place before you the reasons for having issued the circular, and proposed resolutions for your adoption. It was not upon any light or trivial ground that the committee proceeded, and withdrew so many gentlemen from the various counties at such a period. They felt that they had incurred a deep responsibility on taking that course; but they felt that the moment had arrived for decided action; and.that backed by the authority of a most important meeting of the gentry of Ireland, the steps they have ventured to suggest are calculated to lead to beneficial results (hear, hear, and loud cheers). Two subjects necessarily came before this committee, which pressed immediately on their attention the awful state of famine in the country, and the equally terrific waste of the public resources (hear, hear and theers). To these two subjects the committee devoted their best attention, and the resolutions with respect to them contained, as they thought, suggestions by which the existing circumstances might be mitigated, for they could"
"O  not do more than mitigate the horrors of the one, and decrease the destructive effects of the other. The committee believed that the system of supplying food for the people through the exercise of private enterprise had failed, because of the want of private capital and private dealers in this country (hear.) The present system of supplying food having been a complete failure, the awful condition of the people called for more energetic measures than those which had been adopted (hear). They (the committee) believed that those measures should be laid before the country in a clear manner, the plain understanding of which could be easily arrived at (hear). They believed that those things should be laid before the legislature with the authority of that meeting to have them adopted (cheers). TJiey believed that the shipping of the country should be employed in bringing food to its shores; and they also believed that the strict rules of commerce should be in some degree interrupted, and made auxiliary to the means of saving the people from the horrors ‘of famine (cheers). The use of sugar in distilleries ought to be substituted for the use of grain in the trade of distillation, by which means much of that article of human food which was consumed in distilleries would be spared to the people (hear, and cheers). Those things were as clear as it was possible to make them, and the committee were equally as distinct in their views with respect to the measures which they proposed as remedies for the existing state of things (hear). The present means of employment were totally made-quate to provide for the extent of destitution to which the people were reduced, and inadequate though it was, the evil was of greater magnitude when it was considered that the employment given on the internal communications of the country, for some tune in progress, were the means of wasting the national resources, and they called for an immediate stoppage of such a system of employment (hear, hear, and cheers). The committee pointed attention to the want of seed and the neglected state of their agriculture. The hon. gentleman then briefly reviewed the proceedings of the Reproductive Committee. They (the committee) had endeavoured to show that the unemployed labour of this country should be directed to legitimate channels. They had endeavoured to show how many of the evils pressing on individuals might be remedied or removed. In acting as they had done, the Productive Committee were actuated Bolely by a desire to ameliorate the condition of their country; and he (Sir M. Chapman) thought their proceedings were untinged by anything that bore the slightest tinge of party, political, or sectarian, feeling. In conclusion, he expressed his trust that he had placed before the meeting in a business-like and brief manner, the resolution he had been entrusted with, and moved that Mr. Wm. Monsell, Mr. Charles Stanley Monck, Mr. E. Burke, and Sir Colman O'Loughlin, be appointed secretaries to the meeting (hear)."
"Mr. E. Grogan, M.P., in seconding the motion, said that the four gentlemen who had acted as honorary secretaries to the committee, should be requested to act as secretaries to that meeting, said he felt it unnecessary to waste the time of the meeting by going over the same subjects, which had been so ably disposed of by tha noble marquess who presided, and the hon. gentleman who had just sat down (hear). The meeting he had then the honor of addressing was the most important assemblage of the landed proprietors of this afflicted country which had ever assembled in Ireland, and they had met for purposes of considering the distress under which the entire country was suffering, and by which great numbers of the people were already starving (hear, hear). It was unnecessary for him to say that party feeling or party objects had nothing to do in"
"408  the objects of the meeting that day (hear hear). The meeting had been assembled for practical purposes, and to deliberate on and adopt measures which might prevent an extension of the evils under which the country was Suffering. He would conclude by seconding the appointment of those gentlemen as secretaries, by whose energy and zeal that most important meeting had been assembled (cheers)."
"Mr. George Alexander Hamilton, M.P., in rising to move the first resolution, said he had the honor and the satisfaction of proposing for their consideration the first of a series of resolutions which would be submitted for their adoption; and in stating then what he had recently stated in another shape, that it was his deliberate and firm conviction that the formation of an Irish party, composed of Irish peers and members of the House of Commons, irrespective of party considerations, irrespective of party considerations was essential for the salvation of the country (loud cheers). He stated, it as his opinion that that meeting should not be held for the purpose of speech making, but rather for those of consultation, deliberation, and action (cheers). Impressed with that conviction, he would not occupy their time by making a speech on that occasion, although the resolution he had the honor of proposing afforded a tempting opportunity of doing so, and in recommending the formation of an Irish party he would be only acting upon a foregone conclusion, for the Irish party was already formed (cheers), and all there was now wanted was a little organisation to make that party effective in both houses of the legislature (hear and cheers). He would proceed to London tomorrow, and would there use all the means in his power to forward and give effect to that party (hear and cheers). The formation of an Irish party was the only means for making the interests of Ireland felt in parliament. A combination of Irish peers and Irish members of the House of Commons would make the minister, no matter what his politics might be, entertain the question of Ireland's grievances, and they would not permit him to try a crude experiment of legislation on Irish interests (cheers). An Irish party would have the effect of creating and nurturing such a national feeling amongst the Irish members, on Irish subjects, as would have its due weight in both houses of parliament (cheers). It would have the effect of compelling government to take means of averting from the population of the country a recurrence of the calamities which now oppress them; and while the people bear their sufferings with extraordinary patience, means should be adopted to save them from the horrors of famine (cheers). He need not say another word in addition to the resolution he had the honour to propose. The hon. gentleman concluded by moving the following resolution for the formation of an Irish party, and resumed his seat amid loud cheers:—.""That we deem it our duty most earnestly to impress upon our representatives our solemn conviction of the necessity of their now co-operating cordially together in parliament for the advancement of the interests of Ireland; and of their uniting to advocate such measures as may appear calculated to raise the social, material, and moral condition of the people, to save society from the ruin by which all classes in the land are now threatened, and to preserve the property of the country from confiscation"" (cheers)."
"Mr. O'Connell having been called on to second the resolution proposed by Mr. Hamilton, advanced to the front of the platform, where he was received with loud and continued cheering. When silence had been restored, the hon. and learned gentleman said—tt was his duty, and a pleasing duty it was, to second the resolution moved by the hon. gentleman who had preceded him (hear). He entirely agreed in every word that had fallen from Mr. Hamilton on that important subject of forming an Irish party at the present moment, an in order to attain so desirable an object, any"
"(e)  sacrifice that could be made consistent with duty, should be freely made by all, for the purpose of effecting the great good which the formation of such a party would accomplish (cheérs). Out of evil good sometimes comes, and the enormity of the evil which now afflicts this country, and the great good that is to succéed from raising men of all parties, and inducing them to combine, for the purpose of averting from the people the horrors of famine, would have a lasting impression on the future destinies of this country (cheers). Without such a combination, the country would be ruined. The people were perishing by hundreds. Every day that passes exhibits the country in one universal field of horror and starvation over the land. The scarcity of food in the country was deplorable. Work can he had by many of the people; but what does the wages given for labour signify if the people cannot procure food even for money (hear, hear). He had been informed by an officer of the Board of Works, that, in one district alone, upwards of £1,000 had been paid in wages; but there was not two pence worth of provisions in the district, and the people could not procure it for money. The hon. and learned gentleman proceeded at some length to describe the horrors under which the people were suffering, and pronounced a terrible chastisement on the editor of the Times, for his heartless and brutal calumnies of the Irish landlords and the Irish people. Mr. O'Connell was loudly cheered throughout the whole of his address, and having seconded the resolution moved by Mr. Hamilton, he resumed his seat amid loud applause from all parts of the room."
"Mr. Dillon Croker, D. L., dwelt on the extreme destitution of the country, and expressed an ardent hope that no resolution would be proposed at the present meeting which would have a tendency to create dissension. If they expected that success should attend their exertions, they should act in a united manner—in fact, as one man. In the name of humanity he called on the meeting to agree to the resolution without amendment, as the sole means of restoring prosperity to the country, and save the property of the landed proprietors from confiscation (hear, hear)."
"Mr. B. Osborne intended to support the resolution, but he did not intend to deliver a speech. He (Mr. Osborne) wished to know, in case the government adhered to their notions of political economy, were the Irish members prepared to move an amendment to the address—(hear, hear)—and by that course declare their want of confidence in the government. He was a supporter of the government in their general policy; but, in such a crisis as the present, he considered that all the ties of party should be snaped asunder, and nothing could induce him to support any government which should persevere in maintaining such unsound and cruel doctrines, as those enunciated and carried into practical operation by that now in office (hear, hear, and cheers)."
"Mr. Monsell (one of the secretaries), said, in reply to the honourable member, that he thought it would be most prudent to leave this matter to their representatives, and stated how Captain Osborne might judge how they would deal with it, considering the manner in which his observations wore received by the meeting (hear)."
"TEMPORARY MEASURES OF RELIEF The Earl of Erne proposed the next resolution, and briefly referred to the condition of the landlords, whom he described as not being on the verge of a precipice, but were half way down it (hear, hear). The people in the neighbourhood in which he resided"
"410  did not know what to do with their land, and the Commissioners, by their listlessness, would be productive of incalculably great mischief. The propriety of turning the surplus labour of the country into a reproductive channel, and not wasting it on those ""infernal roads,"" was so evident that it was unnecessary for him to dwell upon the topic (hear, hear). There was but one course for them to pursue, and that was to adopt the advice of Mr. O'Connell, and make a ""long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether"" (loud cheers). The following is the resolution:—""That before and beyond all other con- siderations is the salvation of the lives of the people—and we therefore deem it our solemn duty—the present system having signally failed—to call upon the government in the most imperative terms to take such measures as will secure local supplies of food sufficient to keep the people alive; and to sacrifice any quantity of money that may be deemed necessary to attain that object, declaring, as we do, that any neglect or delay in that matter will render ""the government responsible for"" the safety of the people of Ireland, who must perish in multitudes unless supplied with food. That as the people of this country are suffering from a most extraordinary and incalculably ex- tensive deficiency in the stock of food, we further call upon the government to remove all artificial impediments to the supply of that deficiency, by the temporary suspension of the Navigation Laws, and the duties on the importation of corn, and also to give increased facilities to that importation by permitting such vessels of her Majesty's navy as can be spared to be employed in the transport of provisions. That we consider it would be most desirable that the unrestricted use of sugar and molasses in our breweries and distilleries should be permitted under existing circumstancess, in order to save for more useful purposes a portion of the grain now used in those establish- ments. That we recommend that relief committees should be allowed to sell food under first cost to the destitute in their respective neighbourhoods, and that their doing so should not disentitle them to government contributions in aid of their funds"" (hear, hear)."
"Colonel Dunne seconded the adoption of the resolution pro-proposed by the Earl of Erne. One of the greatest obstacles to the importation of food into Ireland was the existence of the Navigation Laws, and it was absolutely necessary that they should be suspended. That course had been adopted in France; and he (Colonel Dunne) did not see, nor did not understand, why they should not be suspended in this country, under existing circumstances (hear, hear)."
"Mr. Charles A. Walker, D.L. county Wexford, said that the meeting had heard from preceding speakers of the state of different parts of the country which had been up to the present moment in a state of prosperity; and he regretted to say that Wexford, which had been hitherto the "" model county"" of Ireland, was reduced to a similar state. A supply of food was the question of the moment. Food should be given to the people, or wages should be furnished, in order to enable them to buy that food. And wherever it could be done, that description of labour should be diverted from demoralising purposes. It would be impossible for the small farmers to sow their land unless they were furnished with seed, and he conceived they ought to be assisted by the government. The small farmers were, in fact, reduced to the same condition as the labourers. He did not believe that there was one month's provisions in the county Wexford. Taxation should necessarily proceed, but would it not be better that the money so levied should be expended in the tillage of land. The motion was then put and carried."
"ie)  Lord Bernard proposed the next resolution. He said he came there that day, not to intrude any observations of his own on their assembly, but to take part hi the proceedings of that meeting, which he considered as the most important that ever assembled in Ireland. The noble lord dwelt most pathetically on the distress existing in various parts of the county Cork, and asked, were the starving peasantry to be told that it was inconsistent with the doctrines of political economy that they should be fed—that they should no longer exist. The following is the resolution:—"" That while we affirm that it is the clear and paramount duty of the state to take care that provision be made for the destitute, we regret that the means hitherto adopted for that purpose have on the one hand proved incommensurate with the evil, and on the other hand have induced the expenditure of vast sums of money upon useless or pernicious works. That this most wasteful expenditure, tending, as it does, to diminish our resources, and to increase the probabilities of future famine, has not been the result of neglect on the part of the resident proprietors of Ireland, but of an impolitic and pernicious law, which they have been compelled to carry into effect, notwithstanding repeated protests to the contrary. That though entirely acquiescing in the Justice of imposing upon the land the repayment of all money advanced for reproductive purposes, we solemnly protest, in the name of the owners and occupiers of land in Ireland, against the principle of charging exclusively on their property the money which they have been forced to waste on unproductive works. That the destruction of the staple food of millions of our fellow-subjecits cannot be considered in any other light than that of an imperial calamity; and we claim it as our right that the burden arising from it, has been expended on the unproductive works shall fall on the empire at large, and not be thrown upon Ireland alone, much less upon those classesin Ireland which, have suffered most severely from it. That though considering the present Labour Rate Act as a most mischievous measure to be laid aside whenever a bettor system can be introduced, yet in order to prevent the continuance of the present waste of money, we call upon the legislature to amend that act by enabling each proprietor to take upon himself his proportion of baronial assessment, to be expended on reproductive works upon his own property, and thereby to discharge himself from any further taxation in respect to that particular assessment; and that the objects to which this taxation shall be applied should be extended to all permanent improvements of the land."" (hear.)"
"Mr. Wynne (of Hazlewood) seconded the resolution, which was put from the chair and passed."
"Lord Farnham felt great pleasure in taking part in the proceedings of the present meeting. The time was come when there ought to be a union between all parties combined for one object, and that object the poor of Ireland (cheers). From the present meeting he (Lord Farnham) augured infinite good to the country. The distress in the county Cavan, he regretted to say, was fully equal to that which existed in any other part of Ireland. It was certainly, the most distressed county in Ulster in the fact he was going to state. In the whole of Ulster the number of persons employed on the public works was 47,903, and of that 27,000 were employed in Cavan (hear, hear). The noble lord concluded by proposing the following - That we have heard, with alarm and regret, that in many districts of Ireland the usual extent of land has not been prepared, and cannot be prepared, for cultivation, owing to the poverty of the occupants, and consequently will be waste during the ensuing year; and while we confidently rely on the exertions of the landed proprietors to protect this"
"412  country from the great evils which must follow from such a neglect, we cannot avoid calling the special attention of the government to the alarming reports which have reached us on that important subject. That it is an ascertained fact, that the supply of seed in this country will be deficient, and to meet this evil we earnestly recommend that seed depots be established by government” (hear, hear)."
"Major Blackall seconded the resolution. He attributed the great neglect of agriculture first to the apathy of the people, and next to the apathy of the landlords. In his opinion, the paramount object of the exertions of the landlords should be to see that their estates were well tilled and well cropped. It might be very well to talk of drainage and the reclamation of waste lands, but the paramount consideration was the sowing of the land. To guard against the future, and prevent the people from sinking with despair, should be their primary object (hear)."
"Captain Bernard Osborne wished to know whether they were implicitly to agree to the resolutions proposed (no, no). He was glad to hear so, for he should certainly feel it his duty to repudiate the idea of calling on the government to supply their tenants with seed (hear). It was, he conceived, the duty of the landlords to supply their tenants with food themselves (hear). :"
Mr. Monsell begged to suggest that Captain Osbome had mistaken the resolution. It did not propose that the government should supply the farmers of Ireland with - seed (hear hear.)
Captain Bernard Osborne really understood the resolution as bearing that construction. It spoke of seed depots; and if it were not intended that seed should be
"gratuitously distributed, he would suggest that they should add the words "" for sale— ~"
"seed depots for sale "" (hear)."
"Mr. O’Connell, at this stage of the proceedings, stated that a memorial had just been handed to him from the trades of Dublin, requesting him to read it to the meeting, and he wished to know if it was their pleasure that it should be read (hear)?."
"Sir Colman O'Loghlen, Bart, (one of the secretaries), thought it ought not to be read (hear, hear). A copy of it had been also sent to him, and would be laid before the committee (cheers)."
"Mr. O'Connell merely asked the question as requested (hear, hear)."
"Captain Osborne then came forward to move the next resolution. He said that if the English people found the Irish landlords coming before them on every occasion as beggars, it should, necessarily, have a tendency to lower the national character, and would induce the belief that their object in seeking relief was solely fo save their own pockets (hear, hear). He denied that the press of England echoed the sentiments of the people of England. He turned from the press to the people, and by their acts he judged them. When he regarded the magnificent subscription which was being collected in England for the relief of Ireland, he would fearlessly assert that the people of England were not indifferent to the miseries of this country (hear, hear). Already"
"O  £10,000 had been subscribed by ten individuals, and if three weeks were allowed to elapse, that sum would be quadrupled. The gallant gentleman then adverted to the question of emigration, poor laws, and to the colonization of the waste lands- He conceived that a well digested system of emigration would be of incalculable benefit to the country. But emigration should not be confined to the lower classes of agriculturists. If they could prevail on some of those fine young gentlemen who spent their time in shooting snipes and breaking horses to emigrate—if they could prevail on that class to go, they would cover themselves with glory, and have an opportunity of indulging their sporting propensities to greater advantage. It was the duty of the younger branches of the aristocratic houses to emigrate, and they had the example of some of the first and noblest families in England to stimulate them (hear and cheers). Without a facility for emigration the introduction of any modified and extended poor law would be totally inadequate to meet the exigencies of the country (hear, hear). Having dwelt on the proposal for reclaiming the waste lands of Ireland, he concluded by moving the following resolution: ""That powers should be given to the Treasury to advance money by way of loan to railway companies that have obtained their acts; such money to be laid out in making the earth-works of the railway. That as there must be a large amount of population dependent for subsistence during this year upon public or private charity, provision should be made for assisting those to emigrate (with their families) who cannot be supported in this country by the exercise of independent labour"" (hear)."
"Mr. George Ogle Moore seconded the resolution, and asserted that it was not alms but justice they wanted from England (hear)."
PERMANENT MEASURES OF RELIEF
"The Earl of Miltown then proposed the following resolution, and took advantage of the opportunity of expressing his decided opinion in favour of a poor law in its fullest extent:—"
"“That the direct employment of the great mass of the able bodied people by the state has an unavoidable tendency to paralyse industry and to substitute artificial for natural labour. That any system of relief to the able-bodied that does not lead to the increase of food, or articles that may be exchanged for food, will diminish the capital of the country, and that just in proportion as capital decreases poverty will increase. That, therefore, any measures of relief for the able-bodied, ought to have for their object the encouragement of the employment of labour by private individuals, in productive works; and that the efficiency of their action, as a stimulus to encourage and force such employment, will be the measure of their utility. That in order to place the owners and occupiers of land in a position in which they can be acted upon by such a stimulus, the whole energies of the state should be applied to the absorbtion of surplus labour, to the affording facilities for private employment, and to the removal of impediments that now obstruct it"" (hear, hear)."
"Mr. Monsell, of Tervoe, seconded the resolution, and insisted on the necessity there existed for taxing the absentees (hear, hear)."
"The noble chairman here stated that Lord Farnham would propose the addition of the words ""for the sale of seeds"" in the resolution he had proposed, and again"
"414  submit it to the meeting, so as to remove the difficulties felt by Captain Osborne."
"His lordship then moved the resolution as amended, as follows—""That we have heard with alarm and regret that in many districts of Ireland the usual extent of land has not been prepared, and cannot be prepared for cultivation, owing to the poverty of the occupants, and consequently will be waste during the ensuing year; and while we confidently rely on the exertions of the landed proprietors to protect this country from the great evils which must follow from such a neglect, we cannot avoid calling the special attention of government to the alarming reports which have reached us on that important subject. That it is an ascertained fact that the supply of seed in this country will be deficient, and to meet this evil we earnestly - recommend that depots for the sale of seed be opened by government."" (Hear.) —"
"Major Blackball, who seconded the prior motion, also seconded the amendment, but in doing so expressed it as his opinion that the alteration was unnecessary. The motion was then carried."
"Lord Milton proposed the next resolution, as follows— ""That to absorb surplus labour, and at the same time to increase the food produce of the country, piers and harbours for fishery purposes, and model curing-houses, with salt depots attached, should be established along the coast. That with the like object of absorbing labour, and increasing our food supplies, a systematic plan should be adopted for the reclamation of waste lands throughout the country. That in any such system an option should be given to the proprietors of waste lands to undertake the reclamation themselves; and, in order to enable them to do so, means should be placed at their disposal for obtaining public loans for that purpose—the security of such loans to be confined to the land improved—and (subject to due protection of reversionary interests)—every possible facility should be afforded them of alienating their waste lands for the purpose of reclamation. That with the further view of absorbing labour, our representatives be instructed to lay claim to such expenditure upon works and objects of a national character—such as naval dock yards, safety harbours, and packet stations, as ought of right to be allotted to this country. That in addition to these measures a scheme of systematic colonization would, in our opinion, provide the means of subsistence, to a large portion of our destitute population—would relieve many districts in this country which are now unable to support their inhabitants—would benefit the colonies by supplying them with labour—would increase the supply of food throughout the world by bringing fresh land into cultivation—and would largely extend the market for home manufactures. That the class which it is desirable to see emigrating cannot do so by their own resources; and that no one of the other classes benefited by the operation would, separately-taken, find it so profitable as to insure their carrying it out upon a large scale. That it is, therefore, peculiarly the province of the state which represents and protects the interests of all collectively, to promote emigration by direct intervention, as well as by assisting, with information and pecuniary aid, the efforts of individuals and public bodies in promoting this most desirable result (near, hear). In doing so he said he did not wish to disturb the unanimity of the meeting by expressing his particular. views upon some matters which were brought forward; yet, he could not but state that he did not fully approve of all that had been put forward (hear, hear); for instance, he did not consider some of the resolutions applicable to Ireland; and, as to other matters introduced, he thought that, perhaps, they did not go far enough (hear,"
io)  hear).
"Mr. Godley seconded the motion, and expressed himself an advocate of emigration and colonization under the circumstances in which Ireland was placed (hear, hear). He thought, however, that emigration was a subject which could be introduced at once; whereas, colonization would take much time to prepare, and they had no time to lose (cheers). He (Mr. Godley) had been in America, and when he saw the wretchedness in his own country, he often sighed to think with what comparative comfort many of them might live in if they were to be sent there, and properly taken care of by the mother country (hear, hear)."
"Mr. Bourke, of the Shelbourne Hotel, here made some observations, which were inaudible. The motion was put and carried."
"Mr. Robert Bourke, of Hayes, then proposed the next resolution. It was as follows:—""That for affording facilities for private employment, we recommend that the Drainage Acts should be simplified and consolidated; that tenants for life, and other proprietors having a limited estate, should be enabled to obtain public loans (to be a charge exclusively on the land improved), for other permanent improvements of land besides drainage, without any application to the Court of Chancery, provided such permanent improvement shall increase the value of the land seven per cent, per annum; that all such public advances shall be repaid on the principle of the Million Act, in twenty-two annual installments; and that a certain percentage shall be fixed, beyond which preliminary expense and expenses of inspection shall not extend. That with a like object we also recommend that tenants, with the consent of their landlord, should have power to apply for public loans in the same manner as the proprietor himself, and to charge the lands improved with the repayment of the money advanced, the tenant rendering himself responsible for the annual installments that shall accrue during the period of his occupation; and that in order to encourage the investment of the tenant's own capital upon his land, his right to compensation for permanent improvements, in case of his removal, should be recognised by law"" (hear, hear). He said that in his opinion the Labour Act, the 9th and 10th of Victoria, would never have been passed to confiscate the property of the Irish landlords—for that would be its effect if it was to be continued—if such a party as had been formed that day had been formed at an earlier period (hear)."
"Mr. Pierce Mahony second the motion, and in doing so referred to a letter which lately appeared in the Times, signed ""P.,"" stating that the best answer to so foul an attack on the Irish landlords was the course that they were then pursuing (hear, hear). The resolution he held in his hand, which was unanimously approved of by the committee, would show the writer of that letter, and the English people, that the Irish tenant's improvements were to be his own, and that the landlord's lands were to be his savings' bank (cheers)."
"Mr. Henry Grattan, M, P., then came forward to address the meeting, observing that he would only say a few words, to show that most of the recommendations they were then laying before the government were not new (hear, hear). He had himself the honor of proposing many of the measures suggested from time to time in his seat in parliament, and he was there ready to support them, and even to go the entire way"
"416  with Mr. Osborne to propose an amendment to the address, if the government did not send plenty of food into the country at once, and take immediate measures to prevent the confiscation of their properties (hear, hear). If sustained they could as a body do anything with the government; but if not, they could do nothing, therefore he would implore of all those he saw around him to stand together, and they could not be denied their fair demands (cheers). The resolution having passed."
"The Eight Hon. Robert Tighe, of Woodstock, proposed the next resolution, as follows:—"" That to remove the obstacles that now obstruct employment, the laws"
which regulate the management of estates under the courts of equity should be -
"revised and amended, and facilities should be given to landed proprietors to sell portions of their estates for the payment of charges. That, with the delays that now exist in these matters, cheap and simple modes should be devised for the transfer, ‘partition, and exchange of landed property."" He said that he knew that there was a great pressure upon landlords generally to relieve their tenants, and they were, he was happy to say, all ready to do so, as far as was in their power. Still, they wanted the means in many instances, and the resolution he had just read would give it to them (hear.) It would also preserve their property, and for that reason he had no doubt it would be approved of by the meeting (cheers.)"
"Mr. Michael Cahill, barrister, seconded the motion, and urged the necessity of government acting on the motion immediately, and passing an act to make all their titles good (laughter.) If such a course were not adopted it would be necessary, in almost every case, to file a bill in Chancery, to enable landlords to sell portions of their property, which would only lead to expense and delay, and put money in the pockets of lawyers, attorneys, and others, which could be better expended (hear.)"
The resolution was then adopted.
"Lord Castlemaine proposed the next resolution, and in doing so expressed his extreme delight at the unanimity which prevailed, and stated it as his opinion, that if it continued to prevail, they could do anything. It was as follows:—"" That in addition to these measures, for the absorption of surplus labour, for the affording facilities for private employment and for the removing of the obstacles that now obstruct it, we are of opinion that other measures of an economical and social nature are imperatively called for. That among the most prominent of these is an amendment of the present grand jury system—and as great inconveniences have arisen from the want of permanent bodies for the administration of county affairs, we would recommend that all the fiscal powers of grand juries should be transferred to county and baronial boards. That in such a change we would recommend that the present system of road repair contracts should be modified— and that all roads should be kept in repair under the superintendence of the baronial boards."""
"Sir Thomas Butler, Bart., seconded the motion, which was passed."
"Lord Massareene proposed the next resolution. He said he could not but congratulate their noble chairman at presiding over such a meeting—the like of which never took place in Ireland ; for as there was perfect unanimity, and they had heard nothing of ""Old or Young Ireland"" (hear, hear, and laughter). He"
"oO  approved of all that had passed, although he must admit, that if he were to enter into a discussion, he could not entirely agree with Captain Bernard Osborne and Lord Milton. He would with these few remarks read the resolution entrusted to him—"".That in addition to an amendment of the grand jury laws, we deem it highly expedient to raise the social state of our agricultural labourer; and that as we believe one of the most efficacious means of effecting this will be the improvement of his habitation, we are of opinion that measures should be adopted to enable proprietors to improve the dwellings of the labouring poor upon their properties, and by proper sanitary regulations to render it the interest of all landholders, that every dweller on their estates should have a good and healthy habitation. That we likewise deem it expedient to increase and disseminate agricultural knowledge, and with this view we are, of opinion that baronial boards “should have the power of establishing model farms in each barony, presided over by proper agriculturists"" (hear, hear)."
"Mr. J. W. Naper, of Loughcrew, said he could not second such a motion, without congratulating himself, as an Irish proprietor of thirty years' standing, upon seeing, for the first time in his life, a perfect neutrality of religion and politics in a meeting of Irishmen—a coalition of men determined to join heart and hand to carry out the prosperity of the country (hear, hear). They were doing all this, yet they were asking for nothing more than they had often asked for before, and that should be remembered by all. His (Mr. Naper's) name, and the names of many in that room, were in the blue books of the House of Commons, as asking for these things, and it was because they did not get them that they appeared there in their present position, and that it was found necessary to pass an arms bill (hear, and cries of order). In saying this, he was not going to enter into the matter, but merely to show that such a resolution as the one he had the honour of seconding would, if acted on, be an antidote to all arms acts for the future (cheers)."
"The motion having passed, Sir George Hodson, Bart, then proposed the next re- solution—"" That among the most prominent evils of the present land system is the want of a cheap and simple mode of checking waste, and therefore we are of opinion that measures should be taken to remedy this. That with the view of relieving the owners and occupiers of the soil from any burdens that unfairly press upon them, we would recommend that the expense of gaols, lunatic, asylums, and criminal prosecutions, shall no longer remain a charge upon landed property, and that in future aft* classes who derive an income out of land shall bear their equitable proportion of the taxation which affects it."" The hon. bart. said he would not detain the meeting by saying anything with regard to it, but to inform the meeting that it was fully approved of by the committee (hear, hear)."
"Mr. Tottenham, D.L., and High Sheriff of the county Wicklow, seconded it, and it was carried unanimously."
"Colonel Knox Gore then proposed the following resolution, which was briefly seconded by Mr. Berry, and passed—""That having suggested above what appears to us to be the best means of absorbing surplus labour, and removing the obstacles which fetter private enterprise, we at the same time desire to express our firm and deeply fixed conviction that any system of relief for the support of the destitute, which is not based on the principle of distinguishing between the proprietor who"
"418  performs his duty, and him who neglects it, by exempting the former from any taxation that may be rendered necessary by the default of the latter, will be most injurious to the interests of every class in the community."""
"Mr. James Hans Hamilton, M.P., next proposed a resolution to the effect "" that the Reproductive Committee should be requested to continue their labours, and take such steps as would be deemed most advisable to carry out the objects of the meeting."" As a member of parliament, the hon. gentleman, said he would act on the suggestion of their noble chairman, and abstain from expressing his opinion as he would have an opportunity of expressing them in his seat in parliament."
"Mr. Wm. Smith O'Brien, M:P., in seconding the motion said he would also adopt the same course, but still he could not abstain from mentioning what delight he felt at being present at such a meeting of Irishmen (hear, hear). As one of the committee he (Mr. O'Brien) was sure they would give him credit for doing all in his power to produce unanimity, and he could assure the meeting he would endeavour to preserve it (hear, hear). It was a source of great pleasure to him to see gentlemen from all parts of the country, of all creeds and politics, coming forward to defend the common interests of their country. He (Mr. O'Brien) admitted that there were some resolutions passed that he would wish to see differently worded, and he would have been glad to have other matters introduced which were left out; but still, in order to affect unanimity, he was satisfied to act upon the suggestion of the committee (hear, hear). As a member of the legislature it would give him (Mr. O'Brien) great pleasure to consider all the questions which were introduced in detail, and he would do so from the bottom of his heart, for he had sighed for years in the English senate house, to see an Irish party formed which would forward justice for Ireland ; and, as they had now such a party, he believed they should get what they required—which otherwise could never be attained (cheers). He said this advisedly, because he felt they were at last in a position to dictate what terms they pleased to the English minister, and they would be unworthy of themselves if they did not dictate their terms (hear, hear). He (Mr. O'Brien) cared not whether Peel, Russell, or Beatinck were in power, they should dictate to them, and demand food for the people (hear, hear)—and reproductive employment to prevent the confiscation of their properties (cheers). This was the course they should adopt, and to effect it he was prepared, if necessary, to go with Captain Osborne and oppose the address, and move a want of confidence if the minister then in power did not at once obey their call (cheers). In conclusion he would suggest that they should be prepared to summon another meeting similar to the one they held, in case they were not met as they expected; for he could state from experience, that the fact of their being so prepared might have the effect of urging on Lord John Russsll to take steps more speedily than he otherwise would."
"The resolution being passed. Sir Colman O'Loghlen stated that as the proceedings had now concluded, he thought that the meeting might sanction their being published by the press, and if"
"permitted, he would move a resolution to that effect (cheers.)"
"The suggestion having been unanimously approved of, a motion to that purport was proposed by the hon. baronet, and adopted."
"C  Mr. G. A. Hamilton said he wished to offer a few words on this subject, as he had been one of those who disapproved of the admission of the press, considering the meeting to be solely for the purpose of discussion (hear, hear.) He admitted that the meeting, as it turned out, was a phenomenon in Ireland—(hear, hear, and laughter)—for they had passed no less than thirty-six resolutions in a few hours, and had no discussion or long speeches, which perhaps might be attributed to the fact, that gentlemen did not know whether they would be reported or not (cheers and laughter.)"
"Mr. D. C. La Touche here rose and said he had been, listening to all that had passed"
"‘with great attention, and had received a vast deal of instruction from the noblemen and gentlemen who addressed the meeting, in giving utterance to sentiments that did credit to them (hear, hear). He had heard their anxiety to better the conditions of their fellow countrymen, yet bhe thought the meeting should not separate without adopting petitions to the Queen, and the two houses of parliament, praying that the matter should be brought immediately under their consideration (hear, hear.) The learned gentleman in conclusion read a short petition, which he said he would suggest for presentation."
"Mr. Monck stated that the committee were empowered to act as best advised, and that would be one of the first things he was sure they would do."
"Lord Milltown said he would second the adoption the petition read by Mr. La Touche, for no time was to be lost, as the people were starving whilst they were talking (hear, hear.)"
"Mr. Phaire, of the county Wexford, suggested that a petition, if adopted, should only refer to the immediate necessity for a supply of food, and that the other matters alluded to in Mr. La Touche's petition should be left with their representatives (cheers)."
"After some short discussion on this point, it was resolved that the suggestion should be acted on, and the petition be immediately prepared."
"lt will be ready for signature this day, at the office of the Reproductive Committee, 18, College-green, (Mr. West's establishment), after two o'clock."
"The Earl of Erne, having been then, at half-past two o'clock, called to the chair."
"A vote of thanks was passed upon the motion of Lord Lismore, seconded by Lord Clanricarde, to the Marquess of Ormonde, and the meeting adjourned."
420  ‘TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD JOHN RUSSELL
"Farmers Gazette, January 23"", 1847, page 614"
"MY LORD—The present awfully distressed state of the country, and the deplorable future, which, I fear, awaits us, must plead my apology for thus intruding on your lordship's valuable time. °"
"In a-season of such unusual privation, and such reckless expenditure, it becomes"
"the duty of every subject, however humble, to offer any suggestion which he hopes'"
"may assist the rulers of his country to meet a coming-crisis. ""With these sentiments"
"deeply impressed on my mind, I beg to tender the following suggestions for your _lordship's consideration :—."
"I propose that immediately on the assembling of parliament, an act be introduced, ceding to the board of guardians in each union in Ireland, all the unenclosed commonages in such union, for the use and benefit of the union in which they are situate, save and except the Curragh of Kildare, &c., or a competent part thereof."
"That a power be given to the boards of guardians of each union, to purchase the waste lands in their respective unions, money to be advanced by government for the purchase of such lands, and the lands purchased to be the security for such advance. That the government advance a sufficient sum at a low rate of interest for the reclamation and cultivation of such lands, the interest to be secured on the poor rate of the union borrowing."
"I propose that an experienced agriculturist be engaged for each union, to give advice and assistance to the board of guardians in the selection and purchase of land, and bringing same into cultivation."
"That the profits arising from such sources of industry, after defraying the interest of the advances for purchase of lands, &c., and due working of same, be applied, one- half to the liquidation of the union rate, and the other to a fund hereafter to be appropriated to the building of homesteads on each allotment of reclaimed land. That each allotment so provided with a small homestead be let to the labourer in the union works, who has qualified himself to the satisfaction of the board and the agriculturist, by good conduct and information, to be capable of managing such allotment; that he pay a rent per acre, the amount to be determined by the board of guardians, such rent to he paid to the Collector of Excise; and if amounting to more than the interest of the sum advanced for the purchase of such lands, such surplus to go to the credit of the union, for the purpose of further investment in lands, &c,"
"I propose that all labour in the union works be done by task work, and that a savings’ bank be established in each union, and a fair rate of interest be allowed on the savings of each labourer, as an encouragement to renewed exertion, and that an accumulation of a few pounds be an indispensable qualification to his getting an allotment with homestead, and that the board of guardians give him seed _for-his land for the first year."
"O  As the success of any measure intended for the benefit of Ireland mainly depends on its degree of popularity, I propose to give to the board of guardians of each union full control over the agriculturist and his staff, and the rate of wages to be paid on the union works; each guardian to be an ex officio inspector of union works."
"I propose that the unions adjoining the sea coast be allowed a right to purchase the neglected fisheries bordering such unions; similar pecuniary advances to be made in this case as in the case of purchase of land, with similar security."
"I propose that the board of guardians in each union have a right to purchase all mines, quarries, coal pits, &c., as yet unexplored within each union, and to work same for the benefit of such union, by like advances as above, secured in a similar way; that all differences as to valuation in purchase be settled by jury, as under railway bills; that power be given to all trustees, mortgagees, &c,, to treat with such board of guardians for purchase of lands, &c."
"I propose that the execution of these measures be entrusted to a board of five noblemen, consisting of the Lord Lieutenant, or Chief Secretary, the Duke of Leinster, and any three others, such board to be nominated by the trustees of Union Works, having power to appoint as assistants Inspectors of Union Works."
"These, then, are the measures which I consider to be best adapted to the alleviation of present distress, the permanent Improvement of Ireland and her people, and to be an effectual safeguard against future famine."
"Their tendencies will be to increase tenfold the present produce of this country, and furnish the English markets with that additional supply. It will give employment, comfort, consequently, contentment to the poor of Ireland. The labourer will have an opportunity, by good conduct and industry, of redeeming himself from poverty the most chilling, from filth and sickness the most loathsome, and of turning his present cabin—not a good pigstye—into a comfortable home- stead, with a small allotment of land attached, to be cultivated by himself and family, already instructed how to do so in the union works. And while thus be- befitting himself, part of the profits of his labour would go to the liquidation of one of our most pressing public burdens. Thus an agricultural college, based on the best principles, would be founded in each union."
"Such a system would invade no right, injure no interest, but benefit all: the industrial resources of the country, pointed out in Dr. Kane's invaluable book, would be seized on and made available for the public good, and the salvation of the poor and the starving."
"There would be no one between the poor man and his natural protector, as he would hold his allotment directly under government, and be thus attached per- manently to the state. Then it might be truly said, we had the benefit of English protection; English capital, and the English market."
"I beg to remain, my lord, your lordship's obedient servant,"
"HENRY HARRINGTON, P.L.G. And member of Relief Committee, Naas."
"422  N.B. Should the chairman. of the boards of guardians throughout Ireland deem this letter worthy of their notice, they will greatly oblige me by having it considered at their next monthly meeting, and it will cost but one penny each to let me have"
"their opinions, or approbation or dissent, or say whether anything in it requires"
explanation.
To add a rough guess at the amount of commonages and waste land in their several .unions would greatly oblige and assist a fellow-labourer in the good cause.

"[We beg the attention of our readers to the above very important letter. It embraces a subject of great individual and national importance, on which we have long and anxiously thought. Want of space precludes our noticing it further this week, but we will return to the subject again, and hope for the opinions of our practical friends in the meantime.]"
QUEER'S SPEECH
"Farmers Gazette, January 23"", 1847, page 614"
"The following is the speech delivered by her Most Gracious Majesty, on Tuesday last:—"
"MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN, It is with the deepest concern, that, upon your again assembling, I have to call your attention to the dearth of provisions which prevails in Ireland, and in parts of Scotland."
"In Ireland, especially, the loss of the usual food of the people has been the cause of severe sufferings, of disease, and of greatly increased mortality among the poorer classes; outrages have become more frequent, chiefly directed against property and the transit of provisions have been rendered unsafe in some parts of the country."
"With a view to mitigate those evils, very large numbers of men have been employed, and have received wages in pursuance of an Act passed in the last Session of Parliament. Some deviations from that Act, which have been authorised by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in order to promote more useful employment, will, I trust, receive your sanction. Means have been taken to lessen the pressure of want in districts which are most remote from the ordinary sources of supply. Out- rages have been repressed, as far as it was possible, by the military and police."
"It is satisfactory to me to observe, that in many of the most distressed districts, the patience and resignation of the people have been most exemplary."
"The deficiency of the harvest in France and Germany, and other parts of Europe, have added to the difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies of provisions."
OQ  It will be your duty to consider what further measures are required to alleviate the existing distress.
"I recommend to you to take into your serious consideration, whether by increasing, for a limited period, the facilities for importing corn from foreign countries, and by the admission of sugar more freely into breweries and distilleries, the supply of food may be beneficially augmented."
"I have likewise to direct your earnest consideration to the permanent condition of Ireland. You will perceive, in the absence of political excitement, an opportunity for taking a dispassionate survey of the social evils which afflict that part of the United Kingdom."
"Various measures will be laid before you, which, if adopted by Parliament, may tend to raise the great mass of the people in comfort—to promote agriculture, and to lessen the pressure of that competition for the ccupation of land, which has been the fruitful source of crime and misery."
The marriage of the Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain to the Duke de Montpensier has given rise to acorrespondence between my Government and those ofFrance and Spain.
"The extinction of the Free State of Cracow has appeared to me to be so manifest a violation of the Treaty of Vienna that I have commanded that a protest against that act should be delivered to the Courts of Vienna, Petersburgh, and Berlin, which were parties to it. Copies of these several papers will be laid before you."
"I entertain confident hopes that the hostilities in the River Plate, which have so long interrupted commerce, may soon be terminated, and my efforts, in conjunction with those of the King of the French, will be earnestly directed to that end. My relations, generally, with Foreign Powers, inspire me with the fullest confidence in the maintenance of peace."
"GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, I have directed the estimates to be prepared, with a view to provide for the efficiency of the public service, with a due regard to economy."
"MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN, I have ordered every requisite preparation to be made for putting into operation the act of the last Session of Parliament, for the establishment of local courts, for the recovery of small debts. It is my hope that the enforcement of civil rights in all parts of the country to which the act relates, may, by this measure, be materially facilitated."
"I recommend to your attention measures which will be laid before you for improving the health of towns, an object, the importance of which you will not fail to appreciate."
"Deeply sensible of the blessings which, after a season of calamity, have been so often vouchsafed to this nation by a superintending Providence, I confide these"
"424  important matters to your care, in a full conviction that your discussions will be guided by an impartial spirit; and in the hope that the present sufferings of my people may be lightened, and that their future condition may be improved by your deliberate wisdom."
"Her Majesty left the House at half-past two o'clock, and their lordships' then adjourned until five o'clock."
"[We confess we see little in the above speech that lead us to hope for speedy _ relief or for future amelioration. However, we look forward with much anxiety for the premier's proclamation. In the mean time, we beseech our landed proprietors -to maintain the happy united position they now occupy, for they may rest assured of it that it is on their own undivided exertions they must rely to avert the ruin that hangs over them—eD. F. G.] :"
"In the course of Mr. Labouchere's speech, delivered in the House of Commons, on Tuesday last, the following calculation of the loss sustained by the people of Ireland in consequence of the failure of the potato crop was introduced. It is extracted from a return furnished by Mr. Griffith :—"
"Potatoes, 1,500,000 acres at the average value of £10 per statute acre £15,000,000"
"Oats, 4,000,000, at the average value of £3 10s. per statute acre ."
"£14,000,000"
"Wheat, flax, and green crops, 2,000,000, at the average value of £7 per statute acre £14,000,000"
"Pasture and meadow, 6,500,000, at the average value of 15s. per statute acre £8,125,000"
"£51,125,000 ESTIMATED LOSS OF PRODUCE FOR THE YEAR 1846."
"Potato crop, ordinary produce £15,000,000, loss, say three-fourths £11,250,000 Oat crop, ordinary produce £14,000,000, loss, say one-third £4,660,000"
"Totalloss . . . . £15,916,000 or say £16,000,000. It is the mere money value of the produce which is estimated in this statement, but here is another calculation of the loss of produce by weight and measure, also received from Mr. Griffith:—"
LOSS OF PRODUCE CALCULATED BY WEIGHT AND MEASURE.
"Potatoes, 1,500,000 of acres, produce 11,250,000 tons Loss three-fourths 8,437,503 tons"
"Oats 4,000,000 of acres, produce 24,000,000, of 14 stone Loss one-third, 8,000,000 barrels; in quarters, 527,000"
"oO  EDITORIAL Farmers Gazette, January 23"", 1847, pages 617-618"
"The 14th of January, 1847, will we trust, be a day long to be remembered by Irishmen — to be remembered as the bright and auspicious day upon which their long sorrowing country dried her tears, and assumed a smile of hope and of joyful anticipations at seeing her Peers, her Commoners, and all her Proprietors come forward to bury in oblivion political and sectarian differences, to join, hearts and hands, for the regeneration of their common country — to form a great, a firm, and a determined party — to banish dissension, and wretchedness from her soil, and make it a land of union, prosperity, and happiness. Such are the thoughts which the meeting of the 14th has led us to form; and, though humble our warning voice, proud are we to think it has been long, long calling for this meeting — proud are we to think we so stoutly and so successfully contended that the Proprietors of Ireland could meet, and, by union and determination, avert the woes with which disunion or apathy would allow the failure of one wretched crop to scourge us."
"But loudly as we may call, we know our voice will be inaudible to our rulers, or too unimportant to arrest their attention; but, when we echo (and we glory fully to echo) the plain but powerful language of the meeting of the 14th, who call upon the government in the most imperative terms to take such measures as will secure local supplies, afford sufficient to keep the people alive, and to sacrifice any quantity of money that may be necessary to attain that object. And also declare that any neglect, or delay, in that matter will render the government responsible for the safety of the people of Ireland, who must perish in multitudes unless supplied with food. We cannot but assure ourselves that the call will not be in vain. Not only that famine, and its countless awful concomitants will be now averted, but that long-looked-for and most extensive and permanent ameliorations, which before we could only see come round slowly and gradually, will be now speedily and simultaneously effected. The numbers, the rank, the sentiments, the resolutions of the meeting give us the most positive assurance."
THE PRESENT— FOOD ! FOR THE FUTURE— EMPLOYMENT!
"For the first we look to the government — for the second, we look to ourselves. Need we say how proud we feel that, in its comprehensive plans of amelioration, the meeting of the 14th has strictly attended to the all-important subject of drainage; and, as on this point, it proposes nothing to the government, but to simplify and consolidate the acts of parliament that bear upon the subject, we are disposed to infer that our proprietors incline to take that important business on themselves — that they intend themselves to be the chief instruments in a work which we know will certainly be reproductive. Remember, lauded proprietors, whatever your titles or stations in life may be, that your country is a vast charnalhouse into which Providence has been pleased to permit her to fall — that she, if well cultivated, and her resources fully developed, would be as free from the desolation of famine as she is from the poison of the snake. Talk not of emigration, until you can understand that reproductive employment cannot be had at home. The people are trusting that our rulers will instantly discharge their duty—that they will stop the dreadful ravages of famine and pestilence—that our"
"426  people will be fed for the present. We next turn to the solution of the important question—what is to be done in regard to the future ? and to this question we give the brief, but full and satisfactory solution of our practical philosopher, Sir Robert Kane. : ."
"Give them employment, and enable them to support themselves. To many, this solution, which we believe to be incontrovertible as it is simple, appears to present difficulties; but these difficulties we consider more in imagination than in reality. We believe they can be most successfully surmounted; and we believe further, that it is now the imperative duty of every man to do his utmost to show how they can be surmounted— to do his utmost practically to carry out the solution we have quoted. That food for the greater part of the present year must be supplied, needs no further discussion. That facilities shall be afforded the proprietors to enable the tenants to grow food for the year 1848, is equally certain; but, to enable us thenceforward to support ourselves, nay, to support ten times the amount of our population, we require but well digested laws suited to our peculiar circumstances; and, as no government can now shrink from this duty towards us, let us see how we discharge our duties towards one another— towards the country, and the government. We know that there has long been a most praiseworthy spirit of rivalry amongst you, to ascertain who could best promote the comforts of his people— the best security for his property. The higher in the scale of society the man is placed who sets an example, the greater its force will be for good or evil. Let us respectfully beg of you to look to the illustrious example set by his Grace the Duke of Leinster. We shall make no reference to his Grace in regard to the first part of this article—his expenditure of money, in providing for the present wants of his people—his success for finding for them just now, and at all times, various modes of employment, and thus enabling them to support themselves,—and his general merits as a landlord, we pass over. With his anxiety that his own numerous tenantry, and the tenantries surrounding his vast estates (too often neglected by their landlords) should all drain their lands, and render them permanently productive, we have now only to deal; and his vastly effective assistance towards that great object, we only want to publish."
"Seeing the great difficulty in many cases of obtaining suitable materials, and knowing the great value of tiles for such purposes, but still ruinously dear, in fact beyond the reach of many landlords, and we may say of all rent-paying farmers. His Grace has established a tile manufactory near Carton. We had the pleasure o"
"visiting this manufactory last week, and not to give a short account of it, we would ."
"conceive a great neglect of duty. The kiln always deemed the heaviest item of expense, is of the most simple materials; the interior and back walls are of common clay, supported whilst being built by larch poles, and the cavities of four inches left by the subsequent removal of these poles, are filled with dry sand. This sand excludes the action of the atmosphere, affords security against the injurious effects of cracks or fissures, which contraction from the internal heat may induce. The bottom or floor is simply of brick, laid or arched so as to admit the action of the heat to pass to all parts by a single funnel or flue, two feet eight inches high, and fourteen inches wide. The front wall is of common limestone. The interior or mouth of the flue arched with brick; the front wall lined inside with clay, the same as the other walls. The grating of the flue is composed of bars of iron, 1 inch wide by 1 inch thick, and runs from the entrance to the back. A moveable roof of plain"
"O  boards is put on when required, as either shade or shelter. We should have stated that there are two of these kilns which burn of inch pipes 33,000 each ; of 1 inch, 22,500, The durability of the walls has been well tested by the fact of their having been subject to the action of the fire, thirty-five times last year. They are easily repaired, and when time makes them no longer fit for use there, they will as manure, on the adjoining lands, prove value of greater amount than that of their original cost. ;"
THE STATE OF IRELAND
"Farmers Gazette, January 23"", 1847, pages 626-628 The following is the part of Lord John Russell's statement as regards Ireland:—"
"Lord JOHN RUSSELL—Sir, I feel that I never had so much need of the indulgence of the House as I have on the present occasion, but I feel at the same time, that I never had so little need to ask that indulgence. I feel sure that this House from the temper which it has already displayed; from the sense which it has manifested of the calamity which has occurred, and I fear calamities still impending; from the sense of the danger that there would be from interposing any party feeling in the discussion of this subject; from the kindly disposition with which I have been already received by the House,—I feel sure, I say, that on this occasion I need not ask for any such indulgence, but that it will be voluntarily bestowed upon me. Sir, in considering the state of Ireland, I will first proceed with laying down what is the order in which I wish to discuss the subject. In the first place I propose to state generally the condition of those parts of the United Kingdom in which this calamity has occurred; secondly, to make a general statement of what has occurred during the recess of parliament; what has been done in consequence of Acts of Parliament; how far those measure have succeeded; how far I think they have been deficient, and then to state what we will proceed to do for the general emer- gency. After having made that statement, I shall ask the attention of the house while I proceed to invite them to some consideration of other measures which are calculated, in the opinion of her majesty's government to improve the state of Ireland, and to lay the foundation for her permanent welfare and tranquility. I shall then take the liberty of mentioning some other subjects which, although they have been under consideration, have not received a full discussion. And we propose, in conclusion, to ask the authority of the house for the introduction of two bills; by one of these bills we propose to make valid certain acts, one under the authority of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and communicated in a letter to my right hon. friend who sits near me (Mr. Labouchere). The second bill is for the purpose of approving the present estimates in regard to Ireland, in pursuance of the treasury minute of the 1st of December last. In proceeding to consider the present condition of that country, I think it will be the safest course for me to use guarded and careful information respecting the calamity which has overtaken Ireland, and for that purpose I propose to take the results of the Commission of Inquiry into the Poor-law, and to ask the house to infer how great that calamity has been —representing an almost total failure of the potato crop. Sir, in the first report of that Poor-law Inquiry Commission, composed of gentlemen of considerable experience and authority in Irish affairs, it is represented that the great proportion"
"428  of the population is continually fluctuating between the condition of paupers and independent labourers. Scarcely one class of the working population are permanently beyond the condition of pauperism (hear, and cheers). In the third report of the same commission, which, with the others, go to form the general report of the commissioners, the following facts are given:—lIt appears that in Great Britain agriculture constitutes one-fourth of the business of the people, whereas in Ireland it forms two-thirds. In 1831 the number of persons engaged in agriculture in Great Britain was 1,651,000; in Ireland it was 1,131,715. At the same time while Great Britain had 34,360,000 acres in cultivation, Ireland had but 14,600,000. Ireland had, therefore, in proportion to its extent, five agricultural ‘labourers for Great Britain's one. At the same time, while in Ireland the wages of the labourer was from 6d. to 9d. a day, it was, in Great Britain, from 2s. to 2s. 6d. When Parliament met last year, it was apprehended that the potato crop having been much injured, there was about to be a great scarcity in Ireland. That apprehension was not fully justified by the event. It was impossible, as I think, for any man exactly to see what the extent of the misfortune would be; but I also think that having had a very plentiful crop of potatoes in the previous year, although there was no great quantity of the potato much injured, yet the quantity of food in Ireland was not very deficient. However, Parliament took means very early in the session, for the supply of food for the destitute, by means of giving work on roads and public works. It was enacted by Parliament, that at the request of the sessions in a barony, parties should be empowered to advance money from the Treasury in loans for the execution of these works. Under this law the Government, on the 31st of August, voted a sum of £1,373,000 for the relief of distress, by the creation of public works. There were presentments made to the amount of £476,000 for these works, and out of this sum £290,000 was actually expended. Before the end of the last session of Parliament, on the recommendation of the present Government, Parliament passed a further Act, by which, on the one hand, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was permitted to order presentment sessions, and on the other hand, in order to check an extravagant expenditure, it was determined that these sums should only be granted by way of loan, and the money was to be repaid to the Treasury. The poor rates in the last five years had increased from £4,000,000 to £5,000,000, being an increase of a million and upwards; and I do not believe from the mode in which that million had been expended, that any great amount of productive labour has been engaged, but that that sum has been employed in the partial and inefficient relief of local distress. The noble lord in referring to the Public Works in Ireland said—as the plan went on the number of the distressed persons increased, and with the number of the distressed, the difficulties of providing employment for such a number also increased. I should say, in the present place, that as the business of the Board of Works went on the officers, found that they had also great difficulty of obtaining trustworthy and efficient persons to act under them. It was found in the first place that the labourers were frequently unwilling to undertake the tasks allotted to them. At length this difficulty pressed itself upon those engaged to such an extent, that the belief prevailed, that it was impossible for any public board to fully discharge its duties and to carry out the works. The number on the establishment has been gradually increasing. I will not read their names, but the total number of persons employed as officiate under this board is, at the present moment, 11.587; the number of superintendents is 185; the amount expended for the payment of all in debt contracted is £2,410,366. The number of labourers has increased from"
"O  30,135 in September last to 440,687 in December. In the last week's account they were stated at more than 480,000; and at the present time, I do not doubt but that the number amounts to half a million. I do not doubt but that great ability must be engaged in the employment of this number of persons. It is calculated that five persons gain subsistence for every person that is employed. I cannot say that this statement is correct; but taking it at four persons, there will be upwards of two millions of people supported by this plan. The expense at the same time must be enormous, and from an estimate I have here drawn up, it appears that the expense in the first week of December was £140,000, the second £156,000, the third £158.000, and the fourth £154,000. So far as we are acquainted with the past three weeks of January, the expense of the first week was £157,000; on the 9th January, it was £156,000; and on the 16th, £172,000; making an amount of £585,000 for the month of December, and £485,000 for the first three weeks of Jan., and it is calculated that the expense of the whole of this month will be between £700,000 and £800,000. Sir, it is the opinion of the advisers of her Majesty, that it will be desirable to form district relief committees, which committees shall be empowered to receive subscriptions, to levy rates, and to receive donations from the government; and that by this means they should be enabled to purchase food, to establish soup depots, or that they should as far as they were able, distribute relief, to the famishing applicants, and that they should not require this indispensable test of work, but that a labouring man should be allowed to work upon his own plot of ground or on the farmers, and thus his labour would, tend to benefit the approaching harvest, and, perhaps, by such an arrangement, he might be enabled to earn some small trifle in addition to the relief afforded him by the committee. After we had considered this scheme, I communicated it to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and also to the various officers of the Board of Works and the Commissariat Department; they are prepared to consider it favourably, and we will endeavour, by a series of preparatory measures, and next by a bill, to carry into effect the arrangement. We propose that these arrangements shall be carried out under the superintendence ol a gentleman, who has had extensive experience of public works. The person to whom I allude is Sir John Barrow, at the present time the Inspector-General of fortifications in this country. I sent for him the other day, for the first time, and having explained to him what we wanted, he said he would obtain leave of absence from his present duties; and, instead of devoting the time to relaxation, he would consider it his duty to devote it to the services of the country, and that he would be ready to go to Ireland at any time when called on. That gentleman will be in communication with the Lord Lieutenant, and will co-operate or not, as he thinks best, with the Board of Works, with the commissions of the Poor-law—with the heads of the constabulary force—and with any other parties in Ireland that may be calculated to assist him. The question with regard to proposing this measure as one of immediate relief, and for the more efficiently supplying the people with food who are in want, will be treated in connection with what has been done already; while everything will be done to give speedy effect to the operation of this measure: at the same time, care will be taken, and the Lord Lieutenant will see to it, that its substitution for the system of public works, already in operation, shall be easy of transition. There will be no rude dismissal of the people at once; but when all the arrangements of the present scheme are made, then no further presentments shall take place, or new works will be commenced. The Lord Lieutenant states that in regard to the roads already commenced, if they are"
"430  abandoned, they will be left in a most miserable state; he, therefore, suggests that these shall, at least, be finished. These works will, therefore, be allowed to go to completion (hear, hear)! With respect to this advance a claim has been made, that the whole of it should not be a burden to Ireland. I think that the misfortune was so severe that, passing by the remote causes of it, we ought not to throw the full burden of it on the possessors of property in Ireland. It would be right that the whole of the burden should not remain on Irish property. I should, therefore, propose, on some future day, that an arrangement should be made by Parliament, by which, in each succeeding year when the instalment became due, one-half of that instalment should be paid and the other half should be remitted, taking care that the whole debt should be kept up until the half is paid: but when the half was paid the remainder should he remitted to them, providing that one-half of the whole charge shall be refunded. I should state, with regard to the financial part of the question, with regard to the sums hitherto issued, that they have been issued by bills on the Exchequer and the Consolidated Fund, but it neither has been, nor is it now in contemplation to issue Exchequer-bills in order to meet this decrease. But, however, it must be considered when we are making these propositions to Parliament, that it is placing a very considerable burden upon the finances of the country, and that in placing that burden on the finances of this country I do feel myself disabled from making some propositions which I should be called upon to make; and all of them entailing expense, but with the very heavy burden arising from the destitution in the present year, it would be hardly fair for the people of this country to propose them; because, whether it is stated that the burden is borne by the Consolidated Fund, or whether the burden be borne by the imperial Treasury and the general finances, it must always be recollected that these sums are not to be granted by Parliament or the Government without the most serious - consideration, for they are all sums derived from the payment of the people of this country, and who pay it on their soap, their sugar, and their tea and coffee. It is from that source is derived the surplus by which we are enabled to come to the assistance of Ireland. The people are willing, as I think, to do all that is liberal in this respect. We must always consider what is meet and just to the people of this country. We must consider the difficulty and privation, and by what hard labour they earned these sums. With respect to another part of this subject, viz., the advances made under the authority of the Lord-Lieutenant's order, I have here a letter from my Right Hon. Friend, stating that these advances were made to persons who really wished to assist in carrying this measure into effect, who undertook to carry out works and the improvement of estates, and who are liable for it in the terms in which it is proposed to make under the Treasury minute of the 1st of December, and which would be embodied in the Act of Parliament. These terms are also to be applied to persons who accepted advances under this Act. These advances I propose shall be repaid, not, as under the former Act, in a period of ten, but in twenty-two years, because I consider that this is a beneficial employment of that money; and I intend, therefore, that the Government should deal with it as with the moneys advanced to the persons I have just referred to. Sir, I have now stated what I think we can do for the present relief of the distress in Ireland. There is, however, another question, to which I must confess somewhat of hesitation in making the proposition I intend to do to the House, but yet, on the whole, we think we are right in recommending to Parliament that we should be enabled to grant a sum of money, not exceeding £50.000, to be repaid before the end of the present year, that is by the 31st of December, 1847, to enable the proprietors to purchase"
"oO  seed for potatoes. I do not mean that the Government should make those advances to the small tenant-farmers themselves, because I think the principle is exceedingly dangerous that the Government, should an occasion come like the present, assume the character of a lender, but I also think that if these advances were made to the proprietors the measure would not be fraught with harm, while ii would be found beneficial to the country. Sir, in stating these measures to the House, I wish, at the same time, to declare that we cannot expect, and we do not expect, to be able, by any measures of Government, or by any measures which Parliament may sanction, to ward off, or prevent, the effect of this awful visitation under which we labour. It is not in the power of man to do away with the effect of such a calamity. Sir, I am obliged to say, that while we attempt all that we think practicable, we must in the first place, refuse to make promises the performance of which we think out of our power; and in the next place, we must call upon, and expect those who have local duties to perform in Ireland, to, perform those duties, and to assist the Government and the Parliament in the arduous performance of theirs. Sir, when I say that we expect this, I am quite sure that by many those duties will be performed, because I know there are many, very ‘many instances of resident proprietors in Ireland, who have been most ready with their money, with their time, and with their attendance, in endeavouring to provide for their destitute tenants. Sir, I proceed then to another part of this subject, and I trust the House will give me their attention while I ask them to follow the proposal of other measures which we think may be beneficial, not only now, but permanently beneficial to Ireland. We say, in the first place, that we think— although we may have been unhappily directed from the observance of general principles with regard to these measures, yet I do think that we should observe these general principles as far as possible, and that they prescribe thus much with regard to the interference of the government—we think that that interference may be given in three ways, and that those three ways ought, as far as possible, to be kept separate and distinct, namely— that Government, with the support and sanction of Parliament, may grant assistance to individuals—to proprietors—for the purpose of improving their private property, to assist in public works, by making loans, or partly by grants for public works, which are of evident public utility; and thirdly, to enact that relief should be given by law to the destitute. I think these three modes ought to be kept as far distinct as possible—that is to say, that when you advance money to a private individual, for the purpose of improving his property, that you should take security so far as this, that it is for that purpose, and not to be spent in extravagance, or for any other purpose—but laid out simply for the purpose for which it is granted, but that beyond that, you should interfere as little as possible with the use of that money. That for instance, you should interfere as little as possible in compelling him to employ a certain class of labourers, and to conduct the works in a certain manner, which Government may lay down as to the best manner in which would prevent him from having the free use of the loan advanced by the Government, Now, sir, such is the principle of the measure of which I am about to speak. It is a measure founded on the various acts which have preceded it, the chief of which is the Drainage Act of last session, and which came into operation on the 1st of December (hear, hear). According to this act, and the minute of it which appeared on the book, it is proposed that certain assistance shall be given for the improvement of estates and for the reclamation of waste lands, where such improvement of the value shall prove no detriment to the legal heirs, and that the advances for such improvement shall be provided out of"
"432  the public funds (hear, hear), The usual mode has been to grant these advances from the Treasury, on an interest of five per cent. In the Drainage Act of last year, three-and-a-half per cent. was charged, making, with the other expenses, 6.5 pet cent., to be retained for twenty-two years, when the sum given to be repaid. I propose an advance on the terms of the Drainage Act, and to extend the term for the improvement I have mentioned. In doing this, I must say that the noble lord opposite is in no way responsible for the deficiency which has been experienced in consequence of the working of the Drainage Act, but |! conceive that the improvement of the estates, if the term be extended, as well as the construction of roads, will amply repay the money that has been advanced during that term. I am convinced that the plan which I have adopted is better than that which has been proposed by the Lord Lieutenant for the relief of the poor in Ireland. These are the reasons which have prompted me to adopt this measure; and I believe that it will not only be found to provide profitable employment for the poor, but will also prove of great advantage to property. We propose also to make a grant for general works, such works as shall not only be important in themselves, but which will prove of permanent advantage to the country. We propose this in addition to the money to be granted to the proprietors of estates, and to give to the Board of Works the general superintendance of the loans. We propose, therefore, to consolidate and amend these laws. We propose, likewise, on the same principle to which I have just adverted, namely, the principle of promoting great public works for the benefit of the State—we propose to undertake the reclamation of portions of the waste lands of Ireland. It has long been stated in various reports of Commissions, in ‘reports of Committees of this House, in the works of eminent writers, that in many cases the reclamation of the waste lands of Ireland would produce large profits if they were properly cultivated. Sir Robert Kane, in his most interesting work upon the industrial resources of Ireland, says, he thinks the estimate of 4,600,000 acres of waste land may be reclaimed, farmed, and cultivated with profit, and by no_ means an exaggerated estimate. Now, we propose to devote a million of money to this purpose, and we propose, should the proprietor of the waste land be unwilling to sell or reclaim his land by means of the loan I have mentioned, or out of his own resources, that there should be a compulsory power to take and improve the waste lands which are below a certain value. We propose that that the value should be put down at 2s. 6d."
Mr. GOULBURN—Is that the annual value?
"Lord JOHN RUSSELL — Yes, the annual value. We propose upon this data to improve and reclaim the waste lands so far as general operations are concerned; that is, roads are to be made and general draining is to be effected. The necessary buildings are to be erected, but we do not propose to take upon ourselves the cultivation of the land. It having been so reclaimed, we propose that it should be divided into lots, not below nor above a certain quantity. I do not think it necessary to mention figures, but I would say not less than 25, nor more than 50 acres, and when reclaimed, the land shall be let or sold in these quantities; if let, the tenant at the expiration of his lease to have the option of purchasing his allotment. I confess that I do expect that great advantage will arise from this plan. / do expect that a great many persons who have been driven to despair and crime from the great demand for land, will be enabled by such holdings to earn a competent living. I think, also, that you will raise a small class of proprietors who may be very industrious and very independent, which will form a very valuable class. Let me say, in the meantime, that, as far as I can form a judgment, / do not think the"
"O  small holdings are the great evil of Ireland. I do believe that the method on which land has been held, is the chief source of its want of cultivation; but I do not think that the small holdings of the country have been injurious; and I have arrived at that conclusion from the fact, that the most prosperous and best cultivated county in Ireland is Armagh—a county in which the greatest division of land exists. If you compare the whole province of Ulster with that of Munster, you will find that there are many more divisions in the province of Ulster in proportion to that of Munster. I ‘believe, therefore, in adopting this plan, and by giving it compulsory power, a great advantage may be secured. Now, Sir, / come to the third class of propositions. I have stated, and I wish to repeat it, that the measures which I am now stating are those which we intend immediately to introduce, and that I am not referring to those which we have in contemplation, and which we think it will be our duty afterwards to propose. But I say these measures, which we now submit, are calculated to promote the improvement of Ireland, and will enable proprietors to obtain sufficient funds to make great improvements upon their estates, and also to provide the means whereby works of a more public nature may be carried out. I now come to the third class of measures to which I have alluded are those intended simply to afford relief to the destitute. It will be remembered that when the Poor-law Commission of Inquiry made its report, it advised that only a certain class should be relieved, and in that class it excluded those who were infirm and permanently disabled. We thought, upon the whole, that it was much safer, in the first instance, to have work- houses erected in Ireland, and not to confine the relief to any particular class of men. Sir, it is not only the experience of all those acquainted with the present state of things, but it is our own opinion founded on a general view of the state of Ireland, that the poor-law should be more extensive than it is. I therefore propose to bring in a bill for the purpose of more efficiently meeting the distress in Ireland, which shall confer on the poor-law guardians power to afford relief either in or out of the workhouse to all parties disabled by bodily ailment. This is what we propose in the bill to do; and to give due effect to the measure, in the first place, the guar- dians shall have the power, as a general rule, to use the workhouse as a test of destitution; and in the second place, to afford relief to the starving people at their own houses, in order to satisfy the general feeling of the country on this matter (cheers.) Sir, I also propose, that in cases when the workhouse is full, that the Poor-law Commissioners shall have power to direct the guardians to give relief out of the workhouse to the able-bodied poor. My opinion is, that this power should be cautiously used and that the workhouse, as a general principle, should be employed as a test of able-bodied destitution only; still I think the House will agree with me, that the Poor-law Commissioners should have the power to make alterations in the operation of this test. I propose, therefore, that in cases of urgent necessity—that is, in such cases where the able-bodied make application for relief— that these shall be relieved out of the workhouse, but in food only. We further propose that relieving officers shall be appointed, whose duty it stall be to take cognizance of all cases of distress, and who, in urgent cases, when there is danger of the people starving, shall have the power to give relief out of the workhouse till the next meeting of the board of guardians, such meeting to decide on what arrangement shall be made for the paupers relieved in this manner in future. Such therefore is the nature of the measures which I propose immediately to introduce. There are, as I have stated, other measures which have been and are under the consideration of Government. With respect to the first class to which I have alluded— that class of measures which enable proprietors to make other use"
"434  of their own property, to increase their capital and improve their estates—we have under consideration measures which shall facilitate the sale of private property (hear, hear). There are two modes by which it is to be done—one mode is, I think, taken from the general principle of the copyhold act. Every one knows that there are private bills passing every year by which certain individuals are allowed to sell a portion of their estates, in order to pay off incumbrances. One way of carrying into effect the principle I have mentioned would be to propose that there should be general bills, giving the commissioners power to examine into each case, and then having the bills passed in another period of the session, by which, instead of one private bill, many private bills would be sanctioned by parliament. Another mode which we have under consideration, by which the same object would be gained could be done by application to the Court of Chancery. I cannot say decidedly at this moment which mode we shall eventually adopt, but we have the subject under our earnest consideration. I shall ""likewise prepare bills by which those tenures in Ireland, which are called long leasehold tenures, renewable for ever, may be converted into freehold tenures. I must say, generally speaking, with regard to the present unfortunate state of Ireland, the most injurious system is the mode in which property is held in various tenures, and under various conditions in that country. The present mode appears to be that of having a small rent charge upon a large estate. The landlord has a property agent under him, and that agent has a middieman under him, so that it is impossible to say on whom the duty of property rested (hear, hear). It is a question worthy of the attention of parliament to consider how these tenures may be simplified, and how it is possible to connect the proprietor with the tenant and labourer in the manner in which they are connected in England and Scotland. It is to the want of that connection that is to be attributed, among the many causes in Ireland—the charge of being a frightful cause of destitution which so often reaches the ears of the public, and when inquiry is made as to who are the persons who ought to be responsible for that destitution, and who are called upon to subscribe for relief, it is impossible to fix on them or find out who those persons are. It is not so in England and Scotland, where, in the most distressed districts, the proprietors charge themselves and their estates with a considerable debt; they make themselves responsible for advances of money by which they may relieve their tenants and dependants from the calamity under which they are at present labouring. Sir, under the second head of Public Works, there comes the subject of fisheries. I have not at present any distinct statement to make upon that subject, but I may inform the house that in the course of last autumn three establishments for the manufacture of salt, for the purpose of curing, were founded; there was a vast amount of fish caught, but a much greater amount might have been had were it not that the fisheries were almost utterly neglected for the cultivation of their portions of land. We trust however to bring forward a measure on this subject in the course of the session (hear, and cheers). Sir, there is another subject on which I am likewise not prepared to make any statement to the House, but in which I know there are large expectations entertained in Ireland. It is the very important subject of emigration. I confess I think that although Parliament may assist towards emigration, the extravagant expectations that are entertained on this head can never be realised. It is stated by Sir R. Kane, and most truly stated, that where pauper families have been removed they never can be removed in such numbers as to have any sensible effect on the remaining population. But there is this to be considered, that if by some extraordinary effort you can increase the ordinary emigration if you can expect"
"O  to convey a Million of persons across the seas, you must consider that the question is not simply whether these people have, or have not, the means of profitable labour, you must consider also, whether there is in the country to which they emigrate, such means, and what they are. If by a large addition to the public funds you could convey hundreds of thousands of persons to the United States, the United States would most justly complain that we cast upon them our paupers, when this was a duty properly incumbent on ourselves."
"If you introduce hundreds of thousands of paupers into your colonies, you will find that the labour market is glutted, and instead of benefiting the colonies, you perpetuate a race of beggars over the country. The consequence would be the crowding of Nova Scotia and Halifax with beggars. In considering this subject when I held the seals of the Colonial office, although I confess I was then disposed to go further than I could go, in consequence of the obstacles in my way, arising from the state of the finances, but I did think that the best mode by which emigration could be promoted was by taking charge of the emigrant, not at his present place of abode, not at the port of his embarkation alone, nor at the port where he disembarked, but conveying him from there to some area where the emigrants might find a market for their labour, accordingly I proposed a certain grant for the purpose of emigration, which has since been continued from time to time, sometimes to a larger and sometimes to a smaller amount. I should certainly be afraid to give anything like a stimulus to emigration, to such an extent as to send a large number of paupers where they could not obtain the means of support, and involving a large outlay and waste of public money. If, under these circumstances, it could not be expected that the State would undertake the whole expenses of an extensive system of emigration, I wish to give no hope of an extensive system of emigration. Sir, I know not if the calculations of Sir B. Kane may be taken altogether as a sober estimate, but he maintains; that there are such resources in Ireland—such agricul- tural resources, independently of the mineral resources of the country; and the means of employment by water power for manufacture—that no less than 17,000,000 of people could be maintained out of them. I do not enter into this calculation; but this I say that I do not think, if there were a good system of agriculture introduced—if there were a good security for investment of money in land—if the proprietors themselves undertook the task of improving the country—if the other classes co-operated with them I do not think the present population of Ireland is excessive (Hear, hear). Sir, I know that what I have touched upon relating to the social state of Ireland—touching as I have done upon many important measures—is but a part of the case. I am not one of those who think, that apart from political questions—from political rights—from other questions connected ‘with political institutions—a merely beneficent Government can restore a country to prosperity and happiness. It is my opinion that other means will be required, and when the proper time comes for preparing such measures I shall be ready to undertake anything for the benefit of Ireland; but, sir, 1 feel that, with respect to these and all other measures, that there are things which the crown cannot grant, such as a spirit of self-reliance, a spirit of perseverence. I must say plainly that I should indeed despair of this task, were it not that I think 1 see symptoms amongst the people of Ireland both of a greater reliance upon their own energies,—their own exertions—and a greater willingness to co-oparate with us. I believe that they will encourage this spirit amongst themselves—I believe that they will see what has been done in this country and in her neighbour Scotland, by industry, by perseve-"
"436  rance, never despairing of success—that they will go on in this spirit, not looking always to government for proposals, and to parliament for enactments; but see what is the task immediately before them, and set themselves down heartily and strenuously to perform that task, and prove that there are means and resources in Ireland which may bring these matters to a happy issue. There is no doubt of the fertility of the land. Its fertility has been the theme and admiration of the writers of all nations. There is no doubt either of the strength and industry of the inhabitants. The same man who is loitering by the mountain side in Tipperary or in Kerry —whose potato crop has just furnished him with occupation for a few days— whose wages and whose pig have just enabled him to pay his rent, and eke out a miserable subsistence, has perhaps a brother in. Liverpool, Glasgow, or London, who, by the sweat of his brow, from morning till night, is competing with the strongest and stoutest labourers, and earning wages equal to any of them. I do not think, therefore, that either the fruitfulness of the land, or the strength or the industry of the inhabitants are to be blamed. There have been faults, it is true— there have been differences; but happy will it be for us if we lay the foundation for the cure of these differences (hear, hear). Happy will it be, if the Irish themselves take for their maxim the precept ""Help yourself, and heaven will bless you,"" and then I trust that they will find that there have been uses in adversity.

"Sir H. W. BARBON desired to know how the poor were to be supported, and in what way the taxes were to be levied;"
"Lord JOHN RUSSELL—I made a mistake when I said that rates were to be levied by the relief committees— the rates are to be levied by the board of guardians, and they will have the power to levy any additional rates they may require.

"THE POTATO DISEASE—IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION Farmers Gazette, February 13th, 1847, pages 668-669"
"The following fact, about the potato plant may not be unimportant at this time of the year. I last year received, direct from the Brazils, two barrels of genuine wild potatoes, small, but very healthy, having been grown in a district where no potato blight has been known. They were planted, about the end of February, in land that had remained in pasture more than twenty years. The situation and soil were favourable; the latter a little stiffish. No dung was used in setting them, but a few decayed leaves and a little sand. Under these circumstances, then, it might be well expected, that if potatoes can escape disease, these would have had a fair chance— wild Brazilian potatoes, planted in England for the first time, in a favourable situation, and in virgin soil. Yet in the autumn the disease failed not to appear, and even carried"
438  off a third of the finest and most vigorous looking crop ever seen.
"The above must, then, contradict many of the theories which have been advanced as to the cause or origin of the disease. It cannot be owing to any degeneration in the plant itself, or to any corruption or exhaustion of the land, or from over dunging, as some imagine. :"
"{f you think this letter Worthy of insertion, as throwing some light upon the question of the potato disease, either by settling disputed theories, or by preventing farmers from taking useless precautions and making vain experiments, it is at your service for insertion.—"
"Yours &c., P. G. in Mark Lane Express."
THE APPEARANCE OF THE POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, February 13°, 1847, page 669"
"At the ordinary meeting of the Botanical Society of London, held last evening at the Society's rooms, 20, Bedford-street, John Reynolds, Esq., treasurer, in the chair, Mr. James Barnes, of Sidmouth, exhibited numerous specimens of diseased potatoes of this year's crop. Mr. B. could find no potato free from the disease, and was afraid it would be more serious than last year."
POTATOES FROM AUSTRALIA
"Farmers Gazette, February 13'"", 1847, page 669"
"We learn that some potatoes grown near Port Philip, Australia, have been received by a lady at Fewington, which are the first, we believe, that have arrived in Scotland from that distant colony. As the disease so prevalent elsewhere among that useful root, had not made its appearance in that country before the potatoes were shipped, we hope that they are in good condition, and fit for planting, and if propagated, they will succeed in introducing here a new and uncontaminated seed.—Edinburgh Advertiser"
EDITORIAL
"Farmers Gazette, March 6, 1847, pages 712-713"
"THE winter of 1846 will be long remembered in Ireland's sad history, not alone on account of its having been ushered in, bearing the grim aspects of death, nor of its termination having ended the sad catastrophe, for deaths from starvation are still witnessed in innumerable instances; but also from the length and severity of the wintry weather having been found greater than the oldest amongst us can remember, and thus"
")  have our misfortunes been the parents of others hereafter to follow in rapid succession, if we be not ""fore armed"" against their insidious fruitfulness."
"Great have been the sacrifices of property in Ireland during the last six months, to save the lives of the people, and great have been the exertions of those whom Providence has blessed with affluence, and whose highest reward is a consciousness of having so far done their duty towards a virtuous people, whose patience in suffering has been almost superhuman. Greater exertions stil! must be made, to induce us to hope, that, under Providence we may be able to outlive the ordeal we are now passing through. Our staple food, the potato, is gone, and our attention has been turned to the production of other more valuable varieties of food. In this, we have so far but partially succeeded, notwithstanding our hard and strenuous endeavours. A greater breadth of wheat, and other winter corn has been sown during the last six months, than perhaps has ever been sown in Ireland in any two years during the same months, notwithstanding the many untoward circumstances, under which we have been placed. This gave us at one time strong hopes for the ensuing year, but alas, how futile are our hopes found to be, even in our most sanguine moments. The greater part of all the wheats and bere and winter oats sown on lea land, (especially on clover leas) are cut off by the detestable grub, and dismal are the prospects of many who justly fancied they had adopted an improved system in this species of cultivation, nor are the ravages of this pest confined to crops on lea land, for in many instances, have the early sown bere on fallow land, and the early sown wheats on land previously green cropped, been already partially, if not wholly destroyed. During an ordinary season, this misfortune would be less severely felt; but, now, that many poor farmers who had to go in debt for the seed sown, are unable to procure seed of any other kind to sow on the same land, so that their hopes of an early crop are blasted, and their chance of even a late one very uncertain; but the land must be sown with something, or the consequences will be still more disastrous."
"In these cases, where there is a chance of even three-fourths of a crop, it may be as well to trust to it, first leaving no stone unturned to insure that sowings repeated frequently are the best means of arresting the further progress of these marauders, and if such could be done after night, which is the feeding time of these insects, or at least late in the evening, so much the better, but let it be done sometime, late or early, and in dry weather. Where there can be no fair hopes entertained regarding the safety of the crop, sow oats on the land, harrowed in with a heavy harrow, and well covered from the furrow, and rolled immediately after as soon as the land dries. Where failures will only appear later in the season, barley can be sown in the same way as described for oats, and where neither of these can be sown owing to the high prices of seed oats, 30s. to 40s. per barrel, and seed barley 40s. to 45s. per barrel, turnips or mangolds should he sown late in April or early in May, for which repeated instructions will he given."
"As the month of February has been so wet and backward, much of the sowing work designed for that month has been unavoidably postponed. Peas and Beans can be still sown, and by steeping the seeds 24 hours in water vegetation will be as much forwarded as if they were in the ground one month in very dry or very cold weather. The same may be said of oats, and even wheat, in very early situations, when steeped and in some measure forced, may, if followed by a good summer and harvest,"
"440  produce a good crop. Parsnips, when it is possible to obtain the seed, should be still sown; the seed should be also ""started."" Where hotbeds are in requisition, the gardener will find no difficulty in effecting this simple but useful operation. Where there are no hotbeds nor frames, and where fresh stable dung can be had, a few loads of it may be thrown into some spare corner of the haggard, or kitchen garden, and in it plunge a flowerpot, containing the seed and some sandy earth, just suf- ficient to enable the operator to separate the seeds as he goes to sow them when ""started."" Or, if there be no stable dung such a flower pot or deep dish, basin, or bowl, containing the seed and fine earth, moistened, may be left convenient to the kitchen fire, and the work of "" forcing"" will there take place, care being taken that the seeds be finally sown before the roots do more than make their first appearance."
"By such precautions being taken in time six weeks may, in some cases, be gained in the crop, besides possessing the advantage of having the land prepared in a dry state, and, by the late working destroy the seeds of weeds which will now vegetate quickly."
"Potato planting, we are proud to find, is being proceeded with to an amount much greater than we at one time thought it possibly could; and, although we do not place implicit reliance on the statements put forward of the disease having already appeared, we feel, nevertheless, bound to caution a// against depending on the potato for a full crop; every one should, therefore be prepared for the worst, and if the disease should again appear, early, to cut down the stalks and sow turnips, or something else to be noticed hereafter."
"As every small farmer should endeavour to imitate the practices of a gardener—for the best managed smail farm is but an approximation to gardening—he should sow as many of the garden vegetables as he conveniently can. Where fresh stable dung can be had, a little hot bed, in the shape of a high potato ridge, should be formed of it, carefully shaken, and closely laid in some sunny place, and covered with fine rich earth about six inches deep, and on it sow a little early York, nonpareil, vanack, or Battersea cabbage seed, covered with half an inch of fine mould; and also a little lettuce of the drumhead, brown Dutch, or Egyptian kinds. These can be sown with the cabbage, and will be fit to transplant out early in April, and fit to cut for pigs, as excellent food, early in June, if planted carefully in a good situation. Few people know the value of these simple and easily-cultivated and quickly matured plants. A few short drills, or a short bed, of mangel-wurzel should be sown this month; and although the plants will start for seed, if allowed to stand over during the summer, yet, if taken up before they start, the root will be found useful to manufacture with wholemeal into bread, whilst the leaves and tops will be found useful for the cow, pig, young turkeys, or young geese."
"Vetches should be sown once, if not twice, this month; and, if well treated, they will be off the land in time to sow turnip, or transplant cabbages, or rape on the same land in June or July, for which purpose Flat Dutch, Drumhead, Borecole, and Savoy cabbages should be sown the latter end of the month."
"Having already said so much on dibbling seed, and having so many queries weekly to answer on the subject, we will do no more at present than remind our readers of"
O  the necessity of attending to it.
"As we have so often advised the economy of food for horse and cattle feeding, little need now be said beyond advising that no horse should be kept, except where he can be made to earn his bread, but different is the case with sheep, and horned cattle. We have reason to believe that such stock were never so scarce in Ireland as they will be next summer; and, although we are always unwilling to advise speculation, we are speculating ourselves this season—that is, by reserving and purchasing young stock at every opportunity; nor do we think we will send a young lamb to Smithfield market the ensuing summer; and hence it is we are doing what we would wish every one of our readers to do—namely, rearing all the young stock that can possibly be got."
"Young pigs should be kept alive by every possible means, otherwise we will be sadly off for them next year, when they will be much in demand."
"Young clovers and grasses should be protected this month, otherwise they may be much injured, if not destroyed, by permitting sheep, or cattle, to go on them."
"There is one advice that cannot be too often repeated —economize and judiciously apply food to every species of stock—husband, protect, and, in due time, use ma- nure, especially the liquid portion of it—encourage manual labour on the field, for it is only by this means you can keep down taxation; for, remember, the only way to"
"protect life and property is, to "" EMPLOY THE PEOPLE, AND ENABLE THEM TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES."""
THE POTATO DISEASE
"Farmers Gazette, March 6'"", 1847, page 714"
"Sir—The confidence of my friends, and of the best agriculturists in this neighbourhood, in the protection afforded by immercing the seed potatoes in diluted gas-tar, is so great that it will be adopted generally."
"The history and progress of the potato blight have many points in common with the cholera, and there is in fact a close analogy between this and other epidemics, and blights of various kinds; and in assigning gas-tar as an antidote to the parasitic fungus, which, I believe exists invariably where the potato blight exists, we have something practical to deal with, and with this advantage, that the remedy proposed does not militate against other measures of precaution suggested by other views of the nature of the disease. My own observation of the phenomena of the blight, from its first appearance in this county in the summer of 1845, has been considerable; and I can fully confirm what Mr. Syorman states as the result of his microscopic examinations, having been present with him again and again."
"It has been asked, is not the fungus the result rather than the cause of the blight ?"
"Unquestionably it is— in as far as it is the contagious agent which accompanies the blast, and not the blast itself, which must be considered the primal cause. The blast"
"442  comes impregnated with countless myriads of the germs of fungi, which, adhering"
"‘to the plant, obstruct its juices and most probably poison them, and rapidly spread to every part of the plant either above or below the ground. In this way, therefore, the fungus, the result of the blight, is in fact the proximate cause of the disease, and just as the cholera, the small-pox formerly, or any other pestilential disease, combines atmospheric invasion with individual contagion, so does the potato tuber become the recipient of a principle which acts reciprocally on the atmosphere, and propagates disease independently of it. It is this individual character of the disease which the antidote meets; and if we destroy the principle of disease, in the tuber-itself, we gain much—we protect our crop from all but a re- currence of the original blight. By vaccination we prevent the communication of a contagious disease—but it may please God, nevertheless, to visit the earth again with that dire pestilence, the small pox. Mortal man, at best, can be no more than a subordinate minister. . ."
"The germs of fungi pervade all nature, especially the surface of the earth. There they are ready to be called into action whenever it pleases the Almighty to make them the instruments of his will. Their nature, nevertheless, is not changed; they require a certain degree of temperature, and other atmospheric conditions, to give them energy; and thus a door is, to a certain extent, opened to us to gain protection, not merely by the application of the most appropriate antidote, but by vigilance in anticipating, by early culture, that summer heat which establishes the mischief."
"Yours, &c., CLEMENT CARLYON."
"POTATO FAILURE Farmers Gazette, March 6"", 1847, page 714"
"siR—Permit me, through the medium of your widely-circulated GAZETTE, to give my humble opinion on that very important subject—potato planting, and also on the early re-appearance of the blight, as great caution is absolutely necessary in the management of the potato. I think-it ought to be a general rule (even with those who are able to bear some loss, in case of failure,) not to plant more than about one-eighth of their usual planting, and if the other seven-eighth part of the ground"
was well filled with the different vegetables that are recommended by those who’
"wish the people well, I have no doubt but the land could be made to yield as much nutritious food as when the potato was in the highest state of perfection."
"We ought to be exceedingly thankful to those who detected the blight at so early a ~ period of the present year. It is to be hoped that it will put people on their guard, so as to cause them not to trust to any late planting; my sad experience of the periodical habits of the great potato blight of the two last seasons, makes me strongly suspect that it was not the real plague that did appear in the English or Irish forcing departments; and my reason for thinking so is, I find that in 1845 it required the whole summer to bring the potato destroyer, or parasite, to perfection; it is also very natural to think that the reason it came so early in 1846"
"O  was occasioned by the intense heat of May and June, and if the potato blight be ruled by the agency of temperature, (as I do suppose it is,) it is to be hoped that it may not come so early again for many years to come, even if it stops in the country, as there was not so warm a season since 1826."
"By viewing the supposed propensities of the blight, it is very doubtful whether it could be roused into action in a temperature of 50 degrees of artificial heat, and that, too, in the middle of winter, it must be proved that its spores, or seeds, were somewhere lurking in the vineries; it was hitherto supposed that it was by atmospheric influence that the blight came on, but certainly it could not pass to the vineries last winter, through the atmosphere, without being destroyed, for it is well known that in 1845, in cold, exposed situations, it did but little harm; it delighted in shelter and luxuriance in 1846; it spared neither hill nor hollow, because it came in a season when the temperature, in every part, was, congenial to its parasitical habits; and this year we find that, in a climate far below that of last year, it commenced its destroying career, and performed its task in about eight weeks of the coldest winter we had this long time. Last May and June (if heat be of any service in the vegetable kingdom,) ought to do more to forward vegetation than four winter months with a temperature of 50 degrees, when it is well known that the thermometer in May and June ranged from 50 to 84 degrees."
"There is another account of failure at Carrick-on-Suir, where potato plants were potted from the open ground in October last, they were placed in a cold vinery; they failed in January, and the great blight was blamed for the destruction of them also. Now, if we believe that the potato plague can kill its victim in any climate, no matter whether hot or cold, we must be ready to admit that the disease is not governed by the laws of nature, like other plants in the vegetable kingdom. We must believe that it can pounce on a potato plant, or tuber, in any place or climate. I do not think that potatoes in a cold vinery last winter would be liable to take the distemper, for I think their poverty would fortify them against any attack from a fungus that evidently preferred growing on pampered plants; indeed I believe that if the spores of the Boftrytis infestans were floating in the air around them, as thick as motes in the sun, that no inoculation would take place. Potato plants put into a cold vinery in October might, to outward appearance, look well; but, let me ask, was there a particle of vital sap flowing in their blood-vessels after the winter set in ? I suppose they died a natural death; something like a tender cucumber plant, that for a time might look green, and perhaps, at the same time, have no root— occasioned by extremes of heat, cold, moisture, or want of wholesome ventilation."
"I had an opportunity this last winter of observing the small potatoes that were gathered after the plough and harrow, on about 20 acres that were sown with wheat; they were small, but they were very sound. I had 3 acres planted in November last, and I am happy to inform you that they are as sound as the day they were planted, and beginning to put forth shoots; any that were large enough I cut, and they are doing well also. :"
"With respect to the vinery failures, I leave it to the good sense of your intelligent readers to judge for themselves; we may be told that the tubers are constitutionally weak, and that they contain the germ of destruction within themselves; I have no fear of that kind, when I recollect planting and cutting tubers last year that were"
"444  nearly rotten, and yet wherever there was a small section that escaped the rot, and contained an eye, it produced sound tubers."
"We also read that small wild potatoes from the Brazils, with a sound-looking constitution, were diseased in 1846, as much as any of our own seed, not- withstanding the great attention that was bestowed on their culture. As to the forced potatoes in the speaker's garden, whatever chance there might be of their being smitten by the great blight, the potatoes in the cold vinery could not be at all classed along with them; many an exotic, much hardier than a tender potato, died in a cold vinery. The variety of potatoes called Red-nose and Blue Kidney, that were subject to a rust very different from the great plague, and were long known in the country; but its attack js limited to individual plants, that I think were degenerating from want of some essential ingredient in the tuber."
"I have great confidence in the veracity of the very respectable persons that gave the alarm, but I fear they did not all “put the saddle on the right horse’,"
"Yours &c., James Macklin, Moynalty, February 27, 1847."
"POTATO DISEASE Farmers Gazette, March 6'"", 1847, page 714"
"sIR—I have tried the growth of potatoes in various ways this season, and I am now induced to make known to the public, through the medium of your valuable GAZETTE, one fact, which I prove to have the same effect on the potato stalks as appeared on the entire crop last July. I find by exposing the potato stalk to the vapour of burning sulphur that it will make it exactly the same as the disease did when it appeared on the whole crop. I think that this fact clearly proves that blight was caused by the electric fluid at the time of the thunder and lightning, in July last. I am now of opinion that there are two kinds of disease following the potato, as I find the rust on young tubers under the most healthy stalks that I have here at present; the appearance is very trifling indeed, but it is sufficient to know it to be the same as last year. I hope some of your scientific correspondents will try further the experiment, and then find a remedy against its fatal effects. Time does not at present allow me to enter on further details; I send you a stalk that you may judge of its health. If you consider the above worth a corner of your valuable paper, you will oblige by inserting it—"

Sir Robert Kane in the Chair. There were also present His Grace the DUKE OF
"O  Leinster, The EARL of CHARLEMONT, Hon C. J. Trench, William Monsell, Charles Wm. Hamilton, D. J. Wilson, Richard Bourke, Hon. Edward Lawless, Wm. B. Wade, G. H. Lindsay, Charles Stanley Monck, .1 ol in Bolton Massy, Sir George Hodson, Bart., David Charles La Touche, Charles Roper, Jas. L. W. ‘Naper, V. P., Thos. Lee Norman, Wm. Donnelly, Thomas Butler, Acheson Lyle, Charles Hamilton, J. B. Bankhead. Thomas Ball, Charles Doyne, John Ross Mahon, and Robert Cassidy, Esqrs.; also Professor Allman, Jamess Haughton, and George Greer, Esqrs."
"The Secretary stated that he had received various communications from several places respecting the state of the potato crop, giving different accounts of its appearance up to the last few days. Messrs. Higgins and Sons of College Green stated that they had planted a plot of ""Early Martins"" in the open ground in January last, the seed of which had been saved with great care; and about the same time they had also planted a few sets in a green house. That both came up well, well and appeared healthy until the early part of last week, when they all manifested unquestionable symptoms of diease, similar in its appearance to that of last season. Those that were under glass, and those in the open air were affected at the same time and in the same manner."
"Messrs. Purdon, Proprietors of the Farmer's Gazette, stated that they had issued a circular to the secretaries of the different Local Farming Societies, requesting them to send in returns of the exact state of the crop in their immediate neighbourhood, and the great majority of the returns already received, described it as still apparently in a healthy state, and all the other crops looking exceedingly well."
"Mr. Mousell read extracts from reports of several persons employed by the Board of Works, in drainage from different parts of the country, stating that the disease had attacked the stems generally, underground though the leaves and stalks appeared still healthy and flourishing."
"A letter was also read from Mr. James M. Spong, a practical agriculturist in Carlow, stating, that within the past week he had travelled over large portions of Carlow, Kildare, and the Queen's County, in company with some gentlemen whose names he mentioned, and that they had found the first symptoms of the disease existing generally. It manifested itself in the stem, low down near the set or seed, under the earth, and afterwards advanced into the leaves and branches. It appeared to have attacked the autumn, or early planted potatoes, to the greatest extent, and even the English Beds, which had escaped the disease last year better than any others appeared generally affected at present."
"Mr. Spong's statements were accompanied by several specimens of potato plants, which he stated he had procured in different places in the above counties, and which, upon being examined by the council, appeared to contain evident symptoms of the disease as above described. They were also inspected by Professor Allman, and other practical and scientific gentlemen, who fully concurred in the above opinion, and considered that the disease resembled in its leading features, the epidemic of last year."
Considerable discussion then ensued as to the course It would be most prudent and
"446  advisable for the council to pursue, so as to procure the best information relative to the exact nature and extent of the disease, and to suggest such remedial and precautionary measures as might be deemed prudent and advisable. The chairman was clearly of opinion, in which His Grace the Duke of Leinster and the other members fully concurred, that their best course was to seek, through the machinery at their command, for the most accurate information on the subject, and, at the same time, to take advantage of the present timely warning, to suggest such sub- stitutes for the present crops as may, upon inquiry, be deemed advisable, and can be planted in time."
"Accordingly it was ordered, that a circular should lie prepared, and sent to the secretaries of the different local farming societies, in connection with the Central one, stating, That the Council having received reports from some parts of the country, leading them to fear, that the potato crop in those districts was already"
"- showing partial signs of disease, deemed it right to direct the attention of all growers throughout the country, to the necessity of immediately examining thelr respective crops; and, in order to enable them To make a, sound opinion on their condition, they subjoined the following short statement of the principle external symptom, by which the disease can be generally recognized namely —"
"That the disease is to be found in that part of the stem which lies under ground, and may exist, although the leaf itself appears perfectly healthy. That it is shown sometimes on that portion of the stem near the surface of the ground, but more frequently near to the seed or set, and presents the appearance of a bruise, or dark mark, upon the surface."
"The Council further recommend in any instance where a crop appears decidedly affected with this disease, the immediate substitution of Swedish or Aberdeen turnips, or of Mangel or Cabbage plants, where they can be obtained ; all of which may be dibbled into the drills between the potato stalks, without any additional manure."
"The Secretary was directed to issue a Circular to the above effect, to the officers of the different Local Farming Societies, and to solicit the most accurate infor- mation upon the above points, and such other authentic information upon the subject as might come within their reach; and also that the members of the different Local Societies be earnestly requested to adopt such immediate steps for carrying out the above suggestions, as may appear to them expedient and advisable. The Council then adjourned."
THE POTATO DISEASE
"Editorial Farmers Gazette, June 5th 1847, pages 86-90"
"AN alarming report having been circulated in this city, on Saturday last, that the potato crop was again attacked by the disease, and wishing to obtain the most authentic information on the subject, we addressed the following circular to the secretaries of the different farming societies, &.C., throughout Ireland, being over one hundred in number. The replies of these gentlemen, to whom we feel much indebted, will be found in another part of this paper."
"O  "" FARMERS' GAZETTE OFFICE, "" Bachelor's walk, Dublin, June 1, 1847,"
"DEAR siR—A report having reached us that the disease has again attacked the potato crop throughout Ireland, especially in the county Carlow and adjoining counties (in most instances affecting that part of the stalk immediately under the surface of the earth), and, not wishing to circulate such reports without having authentic information on the subject, we will take it as a particular favour your examining the crop in your locality, and communicating the result by return of post, if possible, to enable us to lay a correct statement before the public in our next publication."
"We are, dear sir, yours very truly, W. & E. Purdon, Proprietors, Farmers Gazette"
"The disease it appears is not yet fully proved la exist to any extent that —can be considered general, It is true there, are rumours, and unmistakable signs from the Queen's County and County Carlow. On last Sunday the Bishop of Carlow sounded the alarm. After divine service, as we are informed by one of the congregation, they scattered themselves about, and scoured the couniry for many miles around, and returned under the impression that the case was by no means so alarming as they were at first led to suppose."
"We had the intelligence on Saturday, both from the Carlow Sentinel and from Mr. Spong, of Carlow, but being unwilling to circulate so dangerous a rumour, we at once proceeded to the county Kildare, and the first crops we examined were these planted, on every suitable occasion, from the middle of October to the middle of April last, some in the vineries; some out by the garden walls; and the rest in the open fields, separately, and as mixed crops. Those in the vineries we could find no traces of disease on; the same we can say of those in the gardens; but in the field crops, which are of more importance, we observed a darkness of sap in the cellular tissue of the plants, just where the stem touches the surface of the earth. The parts above, including the leaves, and the parts below, including the rootlets, old and young tubers, all perfectly sound and healthy looking as ever we saw them on any other year."
"Whether the dark fluid alluded to contains the germs of disease, or whether it be so far vitiated as to render the plants more susceptible of being injured by atmospheric phenomena, brought to bear on the sap, in its ascent or descent, or both, we know not, as time alone can determine. One thing we believe, that if the potatoes we are considering are diseased, the disease has commenced in a manner different to what it has done, either last year or the year before. We subsequently inspected and examined several other fields in different localities, and the result of our investigations corresponded exactly with those already alluded to."
"Not content with our own investigation, we resolved on consulting some of the best practical authorities whose letters will be found in another column."
"Coupling these with our own observations and experience of this year's crop, we are"
"448  led to hope the cases so dangerously reported are, to say the least of them, a little exaggerated. Nevertheless, too much vigilance cannot be practiced in watching the crop; and as a positive good may proceed from a negative evil, our advice is, to all _ who have potatoes planted, and who are not quite certain of escaping the disease, (as, indeed, few, if any can be,) that immediate steps be taken to secure a crop of some other kind in the same land, whilst there is yet time. This can be done without incurring much expense beyond what would be absolutely necessary to secure a well-grown crop of potatoes in an ordinary season. Let those who have them in lazy- beds (erroneously so called) pulverize the earth well about and between the stalks, removing all weeds, as a matter of course ; let whatever manure that can be procured, whether it be dung, ashes, burnt earth, sea- weed, half decomposed land weeds, bone-dust, guano, or any other simple or compound manure, be placed in a central position between the stalks — the earth pricked up out of the bottoms and sides of the furrows, and shovelled carefully over the entire bed, like "" second spitting;” and as fast as the work proceeds, whilst the earth is fresh and moist, drop three or four grains of Aberdeen or some other good rough-leaved turnip into each space, as already described. The extra expense, in this case, will not be over three or four shillings per acre, including the dropping of the seed, which any little boy or girl can do. The amount of seed required will not exceed |I to 2 Ib. If the potatoes succeed, the turnips, inferior though they may be, will be of much value ; if the potatoes do not succeed, the turnips will be invaluable. So far for beds, and now for drills: — Let them be weeded, and horse and hand hoed immediately, if not already done ; if more manure be desirable, let it be placed between the potato plants ; the earth, when properly pulverized, raised up as if ""landing"" them; and the turnip seed put in, as already directed for beds. The expense of seed and labour, in this case, will be less, and the profits greater than on beds. More we will not say for the present week, than to repeat our earnest and urgent advice that these operations be at once performed, whether the potatoes are diseased or not."
"We cannot conclude without again thanking those gentlemen who so promptly responded to our enquiries, and we trust that our friends throughout the country will favor us with their opinions respecting the state of the crops generally in their different localities. :"
"siR—I herewith return the paper of queries with my answers. I have examined the most forward potato crops, and I am satisfied there is not as yet, the slightest appearance of disease. They are now growing with the greatest luxuriance, and have made rapid progress within the last ten days. I have sown a large quantity myself—viz., about ten Irish acres—and I never saw them, ait this time of year, promise better. However, this time last year they also promised well, and did so up to the period of the attack, when they went off suddenly and in the same way they did elsewhere; therefore their present fine appearance, gives no reason to conclude"
"that they will ultimately escape. I see no cause or alarm yet in this locality, or that —"
"would justify any interference with the crop. As long as it continues to exhibit its present health, I shall feel it my interest to let them continue to occupy the land. Most of mine were planted in November, the remainder in February—the latter at present look by far the best. In this neighbourhood the potatoes for seed came out of the pits in much better condition this spring than they had done for many previous years, and had no more appearance of disease than before this malady"
"©  attacked them; and those kept over for use are now in high preservation, and in every respect as good as I ever saw them. As soon as any appearance of the disease can be detected, I shall let you hear it; at the same time, I hopel shall not have any occasion to make such a communication.—"
"Yours, &¢., THOMAS BARNES, Jun., Moynalty, June 2, 1847."
"SIR—At the request of the proprietors of the FARMER'S GAZETTE, I beg to supply you with the following information relative to their important inquiry about the potato crop."
"I am happy to say that, as far as my observations have extended, there is no manifestation of disease in any form (as yet apparent), in either the main stem, top, or fibrils."
"I have cup potatoes which were planted early in February, the tops of which are now from 14 to 20 inches high, with a very healthy and wide expansion of the leafy system latterly, and exhibiting all the external characteristics of unimpaired vitality—an apparently sound, vigorous, and promising crop."
"I raised a few of the very best of the stems, and have examined them through the medium of a pretty powerful microscope, and, as far as I am able to discern, the whole organic structure of the plant appears to be perfectly sound."
"I also planted 3.5 Irish acres of lumper potatoes, in the month of June (last year), for the reproduction of seed. When they were cut down by the disease, the tubers were only of recent formation, and about the size of gooseberries. I immediately dibbled in early field turnip and rape seed, alternately. The turnips were consumed pretty early in winter, and the rape is now approximating to maturity. The young potatoes were very heavily diseased, and putrefactive fermentation and decomposition commenced early, and thinned them very considerably during winter; but a sufficient number retained their vegetable vitality to reproduce a full stock of plants throughout the field. They are now very generally about six inches above the ground. Being overshadowed by the rape, they are too much drawn; but as yet there is no manifestation of disease in any form, or in any part of the plant, either under or above the ground. I expect that the rape will be off the ground by the end of this month, at which time, if the potatoes still give promise of success and justify forbearance, they will have full possession of the ground; and if not, I will immediately plough them up, and re-sow the ground with the green top early field turnip."
"The rape is a thin crop, and therefore the potatoes are suffering very little for the want of either light, room, or air, and are protected from any injurious effects arising from atmospheric influence. I have also, for some time past, examined many other fields of potatoes, and have not as yet been able to discover the slightest symptom of disease; but I am sorry to say that I have no confidence whatever in their ultimate success. Within the immediate range of my own experience I think there is only about one-fourth the quantity of potatoes planted this year, as compared with the last. But notwithstanding this diminution, we will have a great increase of fallow crops, or manured ground. We have 40 Irish acres of beans, all"
"450  sown in drills with manure, and about 20 acres of peas, with a great increase of mangels, turnips, and cabbages. ."
"The Right Hon. James Grattan and his worthy agent, Counsellor Berwick, authorised me to supply every tenant who required them with seeds of every description, at cost price. We have therefore no idle ground upon this estate,"
except what is being put under turnips; and the different crops are far more fairly ~
balanced than ever they were before.
"Owing to the great increase of green crops last year, we have a great increase of white grain crops this year; but |_am sorry to say, that this cannot be applied generally, for other localities, which I have recently visited, present a very different contrast. :"
"Farmers should finish the cultivation of their potatoes with the least possible delay, and then dibble in turnip seed between each potato, sinking a deep dibble hole or cut, to bring the turnip seed almost into immediate contact with the manure, and to apply very little, if any, covering. Should the potatoes succeed, the turnip plants can be pulled up, and be supplied to cattle and pigs, before they begin to impede the growth of the potato; and, in the event of the disease amongst the potatoes, the ‘stems can be pulled up, or cut close to surface of the ground, and be transferred to the dung-hill, and give the turnips full possession of the ground."
lam sorry I cannot command time to enter more fully into the subject —
"Yours, &c., JAS. CLAPPERTON, VICARSTOWN House, June 1, 1847-"
"siR—I am sorry to inform you that a three-acre field of potatoes, four miles east of Macroom, exhibited, on Friday morning last, the black spots on the leaves and stalks which indicated the first appearance of the disease of last year. I was so busily occupied getting down the last of my mangels, that I had not time to examine the tubers. If the same blight is again to visit us, it is fortunate we should be aware of its presence thus early, while the season will admit of re- sowing the ground with the Swedish turnip—"
"Yours, &c., CHARLES BEAMISH, Buckingham-place, Cork, May 30, 1847."
"sin—In reply to your letter of yesterday regarding the potato, and reports that disease has appeared in various parts of the country, I can only state that so far as I know, or am concerned, these reports are unfounded. My own crops of various sorts, and rather extensive according to the quantity of land we cultivate, are all healthy and thriving, both under and over ground. They are peculiarly so, and the growth most rapid. I shall have the early kinds in abundance in one month; but you are to recollect that all were planted during the months of November and De- cember, in my own peculiar method, in trenched ground.—"
"Yours, &c., THOS. SKILLING, National Model Farm, Glas-nevin, June 2, 1847."
"O  SIR—I am sorry to inform you that my ash-leaved kidney potatoes are nearly gone. I send you a few plants that you may judge for yourself. Fully one-half of them are as you see them: all within these last few days. I am digging since the 26th ult., and I was in great hopes, as I considered mine very fine, according to the severe spring we had. I have taken off those sent all that were fit for table. I send you two sound potatoes, which, I think, are fair specimens this year. They were all planted on the 23rd of February last. I would not trouble you at present, only I believe it every man's duty to give you as early information as possible, that, through your invaluable GAZETTE, farmers will now, at the eleventh hour, take your advice and attend to your directions.—"
"Yours, &c., A SUBSCRIBER, Somerset, June 3, 1847."
[We do not believe the specimens of stalks and tubers sent us to be possessed of such a disease as should cause any general alarm.]
"siR—The last few days of warm sunshine have done wonders on the crops in general in this neighbourhood, and the country is now looking gay and blooming, and if we have a change to a fall of rain in a few days, both grain and grass crops will be abundant. The potatoes which were planted in autumn, or early in the spring, are corning up strong,/and, to all appearance, healthy at present; but I am sorry to hear that in many acres of early planted potatoes in the county of Carlow, and also in some parts of the Queen's County, the disease has already made its appearance, which is much earlier than last year; therefore, in every field where it has ‘appeared people should harrow down the drills a little, clear off the stems of the potatoes, and sow turnips in the drills immediately, as Swedes may yet be sown with a prospect of success; indeed the spring was so wet, and people were so backward in getting in their grain crops uiat turnip ground could not be got ready for sowing in the usual time, and the consequence is, that many people are only just beginning to sow their Swedes now, and as it is already getting late, and the weather so very dry, every scheme imaginable should be tried to get the seed to vegetate as soon as possible, for the turnip crop was greatly injured last year by the seed in many cases lying in the ground for three, four, or five weeks before it vegetated, and where the. seed lies so long before it vegetates, when the plants come up they are generally weak and sickly; therefore, it might be useful to some of your readers to give them a hint to roll their turnip drills, both before and after the seed is sown, with a heavy wooden roller, or with a stone roller, if the weather continues dry, and if the ground has been brought to a fine tilth, and only very moderately moist, this will cause the seed to vegetate, as it consolidates the soil and retains the moisture considerably longer than when only rolled with the light wooden rollers which are generally attached to turnip-sowing machines ; and if the seed be moistened for a few hours in slightly-manured soft water, and then sown fully an inch below the surface of the soil, and rolled heavily, as above stated, it will almost ensure a regular braird, in the driest weather."
"Yours, Sec., JAMES ALEXANDER, Heath Fatm, Athy, June 3, 1847."
"452  sIR—When 1 received your note this day, I had the following memoranda taken, which with pleasure I send you. Electricity was one of the many causes to which the potato blight of last year was attributed, and I was inclined to this opinion myself, from the fact, that on July 29, last year, I had two fields of potatoes as healthy and as fine as I have ever seen. At this time the complaint of the disease became general in this neighbourhood, and from the 29th July to Sunday, the 2nd August, I examined the crops several times every day, ; and although I could find occasionally a withered leaf, I was satisfied that during this time the crops were free from the plague. On Sunday nighi, the 2nd August, however, we had incessant thunder and lightning, and on the next day the potato crops were withered, and continued to wither."
"I have at present a large plot of potatoes growing in the garden, they are very forward, the young potatoes as large as pigeons’ eggs. After the thunder storm on last. Saturday I examined them closely, and was alarmed at finding every one of my potatoes more or less injured. The margins of the leaves were as if seared with a hot iron, blotches appeared on the leaves, and in a few instances on the stalks, but I could find no trace of disease whatever on the roots; still I was apprehensive that the malady of last year was upon them. I am most happy, however, to inform you, that whether the injury to the leaves was the disease of last year or not it has not progressed farther; all the new leaves that came since are totally free from it, and the plot looks again healthy and flourishing. I send you a plant, root and branch, affected as I have described."
"I have about two acres planted in the field, all up, healthy and promising, and not in the least touched as the garden ones were, and I must say that altogether in I this district the potato crop looks better than I have [ noticed it, at this period of the season, for many years ! past. Few -farmers in this neghbourhood have more’ than two acres of potatoes planted this year. I would therefore say, that there is not more than a sixth of the extent of land under potatoes in this district, this year, of what was last year. Large sowing of Swedish turnips are being made in their stead, and am happy to see that the small holders are not neglecting this important point. The oat and wheat crops promise well, as do also beans and peas where they have been sown. I trust that the alarm from Carlow and some other places with regard to the potato, will turn out as my own, if not causeless, at least confined to a plot in the garden—"
"lam, &c., WILLIAM KELLY, Portrane, June 4, 1847."
"We have had sent to our office, yesterday and to-day, samples of fine, full-grown, large new potatoes, grown in the open air, and without the slightest sign of disease. Any person that wishes to inspect them will at once agree with us in pronouncing them excellent. They were grown on the farm of the Hon, Charles Bernard, near Lota and as it was in that locality — indeed in the adjoining field — that the disease was reported on Friday to have manifested itself distinctly, as referred to in our last, the samples were sent us on that ac- count. The gardener of the honourable gentleman, who called with them at our"
"O  office, states that they were sown, in the open air, on the 10th of November last, and that he has supplied the produce to his master's table for the last fortnight; that they are the finest and most productive crop (Quarry's,) he ever saw, having gathered six or eight good bulbs under each stalk. He states also, that he set potatoes in December, January, and March, and that each are looking as well as could be wished, and growing most luxuriantly, and that he has not observed anywhere, as yet, the least indication of blight or disease. Samples of ash-leaved kidneys, of a good size and quite sound, were also sent us by Mr. Cahill, of Ballynoe, near Cove, with a like favourable report as to his own crop, and those in his neighbourhood; Mr. Cahill also sent, some fine stalks of wheat, bursting into ear. We have also made inquiries from respectable farmers in many other districts of the county, and have the satisfaction to learn that in no one instance have they, as yet, any reason to apprehend the safety of their potato fields."
"Such is the substance of the facts we have been able to collect, and while giving them to the public it will be observed that we offer no opinion now as to how far reliance may be placed on the present favourable indications, for the ultimate fate of a crop which will, no doubt, long be a precarious one in this country. In the hands of an all-wise and merciful Providence does that final issue rest, but we are not disposed to raise any unnecessary alarm without, at least, sufficient data — which, we repeat, has not come to our knowledge— to justify us in doing so. There is yet a long time to pass before the crop will be in a condition to judge of its soundness, and there is no use in anticipating the contrary of the favourable appearances presented. We fear that many persons, in their anxiety to judge of their crops, allow their fears to overcome their judgment, and imagine that what is only a natural and harmless appearance is in reality a blight. The following on that subject is from the Northern Whig of Saturday:—"
"Some potatoes, grown in the neighbourhood of Lurgan, were left at our office yesterday, with a note stating that the field from which they were taken had all the marks of the disease. We had, however, a careful examination of the sample made, and were informed that the appearances were not sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the dreaded disease had attacked the crop.—"

"THE Council of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society met, on Thursday last, for the purpose of investigating the different communications that have been received upon this important subject. His Grace the Duke of Leinster, Lord Charlemont, and several of the leading members were present, and the council also had the assistance of some of the most scientific and practical men of the day, to aid them in their deliberations. A report of the proceedings will be found in another part of our paper."
454  ROYAL AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY OF IRELAND
"Farmers Gazette, June 12"", 1847, page 99"
"Weekly Meeting of the Council, Thursday, June 10. SIR GEORGE HODSON, BART., IN THE CHAIR."
"There were also present—Thomas Ball, D. J. ""Wilson, Charles Doyne, Thomas R. Hardy, Hon. C. J. Trench, J. B. Baukhead, Charles Stanley Monck, Thos. Hutton, Hobt. Cassidy, Sir Roht. Kane, SirColeman O'Loghlen, Bart; Charles Roper, and John Anster, Esqrs."
"The Secretary stated that, pursuant to the directions of the Council, he had issued the Circular Letter ordered to at the last Council Meeting, to the Secretaries of the different Local Farming Societies in connection with the Central one, for the purpose of procuring the necessary information respecting the nature and extent of the potato disease, and giving the requisite directions how to make the proper inquiries on the subject. That sufficient time had not yet elapsed for procuring returns from all quarters; and, although some accounts continue to be received of symptoms of disease in the potato crop, in certain districts, yet the Council think it but right to state, that a vast number of persons report that the crops in their districts, have the most promising appearance. A similar communication was read from Messrs. Purdon, proprietors of the FARMERS' GAZETTE, upon the same subject. When further in- formation will be received, it shall be laid before the public."
"Numerous communications were also laid on the table, and among the rest from David Milne, Esq.. of Kiliubnrgh, chairman of the geological committee of The Highland Society, detailing the probable causes of the failure of the potato crop in the years 1845 and 1846. Also from William Graydon, Esq., on Improved Husbandry, accompanying a plan for the general improvement, of Ireland. Ordered to be duly acknowledged."
"The secretary read the report of the sub-committee, to whom it, was referred to inquire and report upon the general means of promoting the extension of chemico-agricultural knowledge in Ireland, and of facilitating access, on the part of the farming classes, to practical knowledge, by chemical analyses and consultation. The report entered at considerable length into the advantages to be derived, at the present moment in particular, from a combination of the kind, and pointed out the best mode in which, it was conceived, the object could be attained, of associating the benefits of a scientific department on those subjects, more directly connected with husbandry, and the cultivation of the land, with the general machinery of the society. The report was ordered to be received, and to lie upon the table for consideration at the next meeting of the council."
"455  THE POTATO CROP Editorial Farmers Gazette, June 12"", 1847, page 106"
"WE, last week, presented our readers with an important report, kindly furnished to us by the secretaries of farming societies throughout Ireland, and some of the most experienced agriculturists in the country, from about 40 different localities, the result of which was, that in five instances, only, had symptoms of any disease appeared. We, this week, lay before our readers 40 returns from other localities, and, as may be perceived, with the exception of a few, all report most favourably of the present healthy condition of the potato crop, and are unanimous in their opinion of the flourishing appearance of the crops in general."
"A report was circulated, last week, to the effect, that 80 per cent, of the potato crop, about Carlow, was diseased; to ascertain the correctness of this statement, we- proceeded to Carlow, on Tuesday last, and waited upon Mr. Spong, to learn from him the localities in which the potato crop was said to be attacked so fatally. Mr. Spong accompanied us to a few of those fields, and, after a minute examination, we could discover but very few plants affected with disease, perhaps, not 3 per cent. We cannot say that potatoes were not similarly affected 50 years ago, as it was not until the present season, generally speaking, that that part of the stalk near the set was so closely examined."
"The curling or withering of the leaves which we observed might have been caused by the absence of the due circulation of the sap, from having the sap vessels ruptured or cankered near the tuber that produced the plant, which as well as we could judge, must have been itself diseased at the time it was planted; but looking at the crops of potatoes on the whole, as far as we saw about Carlow, we never saw them more healthy anywhere ; some of them, especially those at Braganza House, the Bishop's residence, and those in the little farm attached to the lunatic asylum, were surprisingly fine. Next morning Mr. Spong very kindly offered to accompany us to parts of the Queen's county, where he said the disease was very extensive, but we had not time to proceed further, having first satisfied ourselves that the disease was by no means general, nor of such a character as should create any alarm beyond that of inducing our farmers to renew their exertions, and adopt the advice which we gave last week, and which we now repeat. We had examined many other crops through the counties of Kildare and Dublin, and never did we before see so good a prospect of the potato crop as is this year presented, taking into account the extent of land under their cultivation. These circumstances, combined with the various reports kindly furnished by the most intelligent and most trustworthy men in this or any other country, lead us to hope for the best; but as hope is sometimes in our ignorance little to be trusted, let us not slumber at our post whilst there is yet danger of the enemy hovering around us. Sow turnips or transplant cabbages, mangels, or something else on the potato land. Let us not wait for the blight to come; let us have an army in reserve to fill the ranks of our fallen potatoes. In other words, let us, as we have already said, sow turnips in all the vacant spaces, and where no vacant spots appear sufficiently wide to admit of room sufficient to warrant the hope of successful turnip culture, if the potato escapes, cut off, or pull up, the weak or feeble ones, thin those where more stems than one or two and after adding a little manure. If to tie had, and fresh earth to cover it, dibble into the same"
"456  ground at once a few grairis of Swedish tumips if the land be rich, and that we can compass the work next week; and if the land be poor, or that we are delayed longer, a few grains of some of the Aberdeen varieties, so called. Later in the season, use Dales Hybrid, or some of the other Hybrid kinds adapted for late sowing, on which we shall give directions in due time."
"We congratulate the country upon the immense increase of green crops now being ‘cultivated in almost every district, as will be seen by glancing at our report."
"Just as we were going to press, a gentleman resident near Carlow called at our office and stated that he had visited all the districts where the potato disease was reported to have appeared, and that he proposed to insure the entire at a premium - of two pounds an acre. This gentleman is not only what is called a ""gentleman- farmer"" but also an experienced and prudent practical farmer."
(The results table can not be scanned but the results indicate no to very little blight present. L.J.D.)
"THE POTATO PANIC—OUR CROPS AND PROSPECTS Editorial Farmers Gazette, June 19°"", 1847, page 121"
"THE potato panic has, we hope, for the present passed over without having exercised that direful influence on the poor, nay, on the entire community, which many, we amongst the number, had at first dreaded. Thanks, many thanks to our friends throughout the country, for the praiseworthy conduct displayed by them in responding to our call, and thereby placing us, and our common country, under"
"another debt of gratitude, which we on our part, will to the utmost of our ability, —"
"repay. Yet, whilst we tender our gratitude to those numerous friends who have so kindly seconded our views, let us not be supposed unmindful of the duty we owe those few who have entertained different opinions, and had the honesty and the manliness to give expression to them. That there has been some cause for alarm there can be no doubt. That there is stil/ danger, is equally unquestionable. Knowing this, we should not relax in our endeavours to prepare for the worst; let us be ready to meet the enemy whenever he shall appear. Let our farming friends not for a moment suppose that the danger is over, for the ""blight"" may come like, a thief in the night, and destroy not only our prospects of potatoes, but of corn also, as it did to the oat crop last year, and to it and other crops often before. Let us not again trust to any crop as the stable of our food, for so sure as we do, so sure will we be, as we should be, overtaken by the enemy, against whose destructive powers we are so justly forewarned."
"To our agricultural, aye, and horticultural readers, we repeat our admonition, sow and plant everything that can be sown and planted whilst there is yet time. Such crops as you have sown are now, thanks to a bountiful Providence, thriving to a degree beyond our expectations, and, perhaps, far beyond our deserts. Let these crops, we say, be done justice to, in their weeding, hoeing, cleaning, harvesting, and husbanding, and we can have no great cause for alarm—that is,"
"OQ  provided we can make our own people consumers, as well us producers, of the fruits of the earth which they have toiled and laboured to cultivate."
"To our provision merchants we now address ourselves, and beg to remind them that the harvest of 1847 is likely to be an abundant one, so far as present appearances can lead us to predict. Whether the produce of this- contemplated abundant harvest be consumed in Ireland wholly, or in a legitimate part, matters little, in one respect, provided food can be had elsewhere at a cheap rate, which will be the case next year, for if we are not misinformed, America will send corn in here next year at Id. Per Ib., Is. 2d. per stone, 9s. 4d. per cwt., or £9 6s. 8d. per ton. The Americans are determined to do that; so take care how you hoard up provisions until they become unfit for human food, and may hereafter be obliged, as formerly was done, to throw them into the Liffey."
"But we will come nearer home, and admit what we do not believe, that we will not be left enough of our own produce to support us, and that our American friends will forget us and their own interest (a case very unlikely). There is this year a species of provision growing in Ireland that will not, that cannot, be removed out of the country, with so much profit to the grower, as if consumed at home—we mean turnips. We will give you one statistical fact that will for the present answer our purpose, and it may serve you too. There were some dozen. or twenty seed warehouses in Dublin selling out seeds night and day, we may say for the last six or eight months; they have still six weeks work at the same lucrative and laudable trade. Out of this number we have selected two who had sold up to the morning of Saturday the 12th inst. in round numbers, 3,500 bushels of turnip seed; and, as every bushel of such seed was quite sufficient for 16 acres, plantation measure, the number of acres supplied with seed from these two houses alone, amount to 56,000."
"Suppose, and we are much under the mark in so doing, that all the other, houses put together sold an equal amount, we have an addition of 56,000"
"Then we have Cork, Limerick, Belfast, Liverpool, Bristol, London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, and hundreds of other places throughout Ireland, England, and Scotland, supplying us; and supposing that all these supplied as much seed as the other houses first mentioned, and the rest of the Dublin houses included, we have 112,000"
"Making a total in Irish acres of ... 224,000. Or, in round numbers, over 362,000 statute acres sown under turnips alone. Think a little on that subject, and we may perhaps refresh your memory again. In the meantime, we do not want to disguise from you that there have been symptoms of disease in the potato crop in some few places, but by no means to such an extent, nor of such a character, as to cause you to rise your prices through the fears of timid or inexperienced men; and to show you that those fears were unjustly founded, we will state a fact that will, or :at least should, make some of our botanists, who have rung the changes on cause and effect, blush at their ignorance, or to be more merciful, at their simple negligence of duty. It is well known to us, and has been long known to our ancestors, that there are certain potatoes that, when grown a second year in any part of Ireland, hare produced diseased stems, such as we saw this year. It has been long known that there are certain parts of other potatoes that produce"
"458  healthy stems, whilst other parts of the same tubers produced diseased stems, such as we see this year. It is well known to every farmer in Fingal, that to produce good pink-eyes or bangors for the Dublin market, he must have his seed (so called) from Cumberland, Campbeltown, or from some other place at the other side the water—and more shame to them and the country, when they could have as good out of the bogs of Connaught or Munster, if treated as the editor of this paper pointed out some 16 or 18 years ago, and even within the last two years. Yet our electricity - mongers and wire-workers, and Botrytis fishers, never as yet jobbed, worked, or fished out the cause of this national loss, sustained under their noses, whilst they are turning their brain, and the brains of the nation, in endeavouring to explain other causes of which they are as ignorant as they are of the north pole. Perhaps they will do so yet, although we doubt it. Still we have every hope of seeing this, as well as many other parts of our national industry, encouraged under a new order of things, which we are ‘proud to find going forward under the presidency of Sir Robert Kane, in the industrial commission. ."
"We have this week but a few letters to notice relative to the potato disease. The first is from Mr. Hunter, at Glenville, near Cork, who says—"" There is not one- fourth of the quantity planted compared to 1846, which did not amount to more than three-fourths of 1845."" He says the disease has appeared but not as yet generally so."
"The next is from the Rev. Wm. R. Townsend, Rector Aghadda, Co. Cork also, who says ""there is not anything like a twentieth part planted” this year compared to the last. "" No disease."" He enumerates a great variety, and shows a great increase of green crops. ""Wheat particolarly fine; oats good; barley good.” We now turn to the north, to notice the reply of a first-rate practical, as well as scientific agriculturist, Mr. R. O. Pringle, Ingram Farm, Lisburn, who says—quantity planted, “one-fourth” compared to last year. ""No appearance of disease, the crops looking well, and remarkably free from blanks."" Corn crops—."" !n general excellent."""
"We will conclude our remarks this week with an extract from a letter received by Maurice O'Connell, Esq., from his steward, Mr. Divine, at Derrynane Abbey. He says—"" The crops are looking well, the potatoes in particular are most promising all through the country; but there are some of the people that will not be persuaded but that they are in some places showing symptoms of the blight of last year, but I hope and trust that their fears are unfounded."""

"siR—I have the pleasure to inform you that I have made every inquiry in this town and neighbourhood, and find that the crops in general look well; and as the present fine weather will force .them on, we may expect an early harvest. The potatoes look very healthy, and no sign of any disease, so far as my"

"POTATO PANIC — OUR CROPS AND PROSPECTS Editorial - Farmers Gazette, June 26"", 1847, page 137"
"THE alarm seems much abated, not withstanding that some few reports of complaints are being made on potatoes grown from tubers obtained from Spain, and other warm climates; and even in such crops there is little to excite alarm, now that we are forewarned, and as we have, thanks to our friends, continuously shown also, forearmed. ;"
"That potatoes, or rather tubers obtained from Spain, should produce plants, liable to be affected by the variableness of our colder climate, is just as natural as that the olive and vine should be unable to ripen their fruits in the open air in Ireland, not withstanding that they are the staple crops in Spain and other continental countries. We repeat our question of last week, can any of our botanists tell us why pinkeyes, bangors, and some other varieties of potatoes, grown in the County Dublin, will produce diseased plants the following year? or what would be of more value to the country will any of our experimental botanists and garden farmers tell as how we can prevent the ""curl"" in the varieties we have mentioned, if once grown in the County Dublin ?"
"The Royal Dublin Society are, we understand, now about to elect a professor of botany, and as that society patronises everything useful, would not the above sub- ject be a legitimate test. We pause for a reply. We would therefore in the meantime caution the public against being influenced in the slightest degree by reports, which frequently appear from persons in the daily prints ; and we, at the same time, caution them against resting on their oars, whilst there is still danger."
"The potato crop may yet prove a failure, flattering although our hopes founded on our own extensive observation, and the much more extensive information derived from every corner of the island. Our wheats now coming so beautifully into ear may be blighted before they arrive at anything like perfection—the same may be said of our oats, barley, bere, and rye—and notwithstanding that nature may have done everything that can render such crops not only prolific, but highly productive, another freak of her's, during the harvest, may falsify all the hopes founded on her summer smiles. Last week we gave some statistics of turnip culture; from all we have since learned we were then under the mark, and we have now some good reason to believe, that before long there will have been sown over 500,000 statute acres of turnips in Ireland. We are preparing some statistics of the other green crops, such as mangels, parsnips, carrots, peas, and beans; and when we have these prepared they will surprise some of our friends, as genuine though our hopes were and still are. There was one thing which we always dreaded, and indeed such was our fear, that we could not bring ourselves to approach it quietly, lest that by so doing we should be adding to the panic. It was that our large farmers should be silly enough to lay down their lands this year on a more extensive scale than"
"460  upon any other year. This we are proud to say is not the case, for not withstanding- that clover culture should be always encouraged, but not abused, we find this year a vast falling off on the sales of clovers and grasses. This coupled with the vast in- crease of turnip culture, augurs well for the country, as it proves that the large farmers are now beginning to see in what their real interest consist. Having so often repeated our advice to sow tumips amongst the potato, pease, and bean crops, and, every where after, vetches; and finding that our advice has been much taken, even where we least expected, we need not do more than hint that the season is, still, both suitable and propitious for such purposes. The mangel crop has been, we understand, a successful one, almost everywhere, and as there will be many plants to spare, we would say, to all who may have an adequate supply of turnips sown, or who may have, still, clear ground to afford a sufficient supply, transplant mangels between the potatoes. After earthing the latter, sow cabbage seeds, and have the plants ready to stick in where the potatoes aregrowing, should they chance to fail at any time before November; under Providence, aided by the wisdom of our rulers, and American friends, we will have, next year, food in abundance for man and beast, and, by progressive improvements, a few years will not only render us independent of the potato, but, also, guard as against letting it ever become an abuse."
CROPS AND PROSPECTS OF JULY
"Editorial - Farmers Gazette, July 3"" 1847, page 153"
"THE potatoes, notwithstanding all that has been said against them, are still reported to be as a whole most thriving and luxuriant. Our reports state that in every town and village they are appearing by degrees at market, and in a most healthy condition, but sold still at prices to be afforded only by the rich who use them as a delicacy or a luxury, and in which case, as a change of diet, we hope they shall evermore be looked on in Ireland, now that we know how to do without them; and as we have every hope that as long as it shall please Providence that we shall merit the kind feeling and be able to prove interesting to our good transatlantic friends, that after this year we shall never more want the potatoes in any other way than as described above."
"One of the most strange, indeed we had almost said amusing circumstances, that is if anything could amuse in such a case, connected with the late potato panic, was that of seeing at the Rotundo on last Wednesday, where the fruit and flower show was held, splendid collections of potatoes from all quarters, and amongst those the condition of the collection of potatoes sent from Col. Bruen's gardens at Carlow obtained for them the first prize. Yes, Carlow, the plague-spot of Ireland, has sent to the Rotundo potatoes which for beauty and health, which at this season of the year, or any year for the last century, could not be exceeded not only in Ireland but any place else that we have any knowledge of."
"Colonel Bruen's very intelligent and respectable gardener, Mr. Locke, gave us some specimens, none of the best, of these tubers, which can be seen now at our"
"O  office. There are eight varieties of them, including Ashleaved-kidneys, Fox's seedling, Bangors, Pinkeyes, Rednose, and Purple kidneys, Cups, &c., &c."
"The thanks of the community are due to Mr.. Locke, an honest Englishman, for having brought up these potatoes and beating Paddy on his own dunghill, and with Paddy's favorite too, the potato."
"The above, as far as present appearances go, regarding the potato, is very cheering; but there is an old saying—""Let us not tally-ho till we are out of the wood."" :"
"We are just now on the eve of the week on which we sounded the alarm ourselves last year, as can be seen by reference to our paper of the 11th July; and although we, by no means as yet, feel warranted in anticipating a similar alarm this year at the nor at any time, we know not that the ink we are using will be dry, before we may experience a similar catastrophe, no more than we can calculate, with any degree of certainty, of living to see what we are writing in print."
"Let us once more implore and beseech every man, from the highest peer in the realm to the poorest peasant in the cabin to cultivate everything that can be cultivated and to not only do so themselves, but to aid and stimulate others who may not have the"
"means, nor the will, not alone on all vacant or, un-cropped land, but also amongst other crops capable of admitting of mixed culture; but, above all, amongst the potato crops of early and late cultivation; the latter most certainly. Don't depend upon any one crop, and depend least of all on the potato; every crop is liable to be destroyed at a time, perhaps, least expected, bur most assuredly is the potato liable, and in a ten fold degree more than any other."
"The weather appears propitious for fertilizing all our crops to a degree, perhaps, unprecedented in the annals of agriculture. The extent of cultivation, not only of corn, but as we have already shown and will further show, of other crops, is far greater than the most sanguine or most zealous, amongst us could, six months ago by possibility, calculate upon. All are thriving to a degree greater than most experimental agriculturists could form a preconceived opinion of, yet in all, or in a majority of cases, our hopes may be blasted, when we least expect it. But supposing that in every one of our crops, the fatal potato not excepted, we should justly calculate on the greatest possible success, a question arises — how are we to meet our American friends in competition in the English or Scotch markets, nay, our own ports ? This is a question that now occupies the farmers' attention, and conjures up his fears, and between the cry of famine and its consequences, local ruinous taxation, and the open ports, to the vast produce of our American, aye, and our Russian friends, the farmer is on the horns of a dilemma. How is he to escape one without being gored by the other ? The answer is simple, and easy of solution: — Make the land produce as much as nature, aided by art, is capable of doing, then and then only, can we calculate on anything like safety from either the one or the other. It is only by abundant produce that we can hope to exist, and it is only by making the people consumers, as well as producers, that we deserve to exist. We occupied more time and space with these subjects this week, than may be"
"462  considered warrantable by those who take little trouble to think; but, as it is the business of every man to think, and to think seriously on what we are likely to meet, it is also the business of every man to assist in improving the thinking faculties of his neighbour, and this is our apology, if such be needed."
"- POTATO PRUNING Farmers Gazette, July 3"", 1847, page 155"
"sIR—It is the founded opinion that the disease affecting the growth of the potato appears in brown spots on that part of the stalk nearest the seed, and extending upwards, infecting the tubers, which, according to the laws of nature, are formed mid-way between the seed and surface. On the appearance of this dis- ease, some recommend the immediate substitute, to sow turnips, from the opinion that the disease will end in their destruction. I denominate this disease black-leg, originating from the agency of insect, and creating cancer as it ascends, ending in the death of the whole principal. To all, therefore, whom this may concern, cut this black leg while under the earth, above the affected part, then draw out that part of the leg with the disease, and mould up the plants. By this experiment I find where the buds are well established in root and top, and by this process they will prosper when moulded up, independent of the seed, this propitious season.—"
"Yours, &c., J. L., Lurganboy, Manorhamilton, June 23, 1847."
"[As there are many trying experiments, this season, in the endeavour to obtain sound potatoes from what they conceive diseased stems, we would recommend the above system as one fit to be of the number.]"
THE CROPS—PROSPECTS AND PRECAUTIONS
"Editorial - Farmers Gazette, July 10°"", 1847, page 168"
"THE corn crops are still doing well, so far as present appearances go, and notwithstanding that these appearances are so much in their favor, we might find them, each and all blighted, as we often did before, to a greater or leas extent. Witness the oats of last year, which looked as well at this time as the oats do now, and afterwards did not turn out more than half a crop; so with the wheat on many former years, for this is the critical period of fertilizing, which, however successful it may be, the harvest may, after all, be a very different one, both as regards quantity and quality of grain, in the latter especially we may be sadly disappointed, and be it remembered, as a very clever sensible writer hints, in another part of our paper of this day, we have a stock of old corn on hands, and no matter how successful the potatoes may be the quantity produced will not be over half that required on other years for seed alone. In a word, we cannot calculate on the potatoes this year as"
"QO  food, beyond a little luxury for the rich, or affluent, and it is rather fortunate the people now feel they can do without them. We had many deaths this year from want of them; heretofore we had many deaths, every year, from the early and too frequent use of them. If they were to be used early, and frequently, this year under the altered habits and altered constitutions of the people, the Irish cholera would rage more desperately than it ever did before, for amongst the few I that are using them already, we hear many complaints, and if we could hope that no deaths would be the consequence we would scarcely regret these complaints, as our wish is, that the people would dislike them, and have a taste for better food, and be enabled to procure it as we hope they will. Be that as it may, we should never depend, one instant, on them; at best they were the very worst food for man, and the most uncertain of all the crops the Irish soil could produce. They are still comparatively safe; and although trifling the amount planted, one hour, or one moment's revolution of the elements of nature may destroy the entire, and that revolution may occur at any time before they are dug, or housed; nor will they be safe from destruction, even then, as sad experience has already proved to us. Let none of our readers be, then, surprised at our repeated warnings against trusting to, or confiding in the potato one hour, no matter how flattering our reports, and the reports of our kind friends through the country, may be."
"We had this week a series of sensibly written letters all giving favourable accounts of the crops, but each agreeing with us in the wholesomeness of our warnings against placing any confidence in the potato crop as the staple food of the people, or, in fact, as food at all, except, as we before stated, as a luxury or change of diet, in which case, and in which case only, should we ever use them. The provision merchants will supply us as long as it is their interest to import from other coun- tries, and no matter how successful the potato, and how abundant the other crops of this year, there will be a fair profit for the importer for many years to come; ex- cept we turn the tables, and apply the profits to the cultivation of the land, for it is only by an increased produce we can compete with the foreigner, and our lands, if well cultivated, are capable of such increase as to enable us to defy the whole world in competition at our own doors at least. Our business will be to show how that can be done. The country has made a good beginning, but let us not halt or falter in the good fight whilst the enemy is before us; let us keep steadily on in our courses of cropping, for if we fancy we have gone far enough, we will find ourselves sadly mistaken. The harvest is fast approaching, let us make the best use of our time till it arrives; still let us sow turnips on every spare spot, even between the drills of potatoes, as well as between the plants in the drills, in the furrows of the lazy-beds, as well as between the plants in the beds. Remember this warning; they will be all wanting."
"Seed is cheap, labour is now cheap, weeds are abundant, which, in a few days, can be converted into manure; portable manures are cheap, and easy of application. If we now neglect to provide food for ourselves, let us blame ourselves hereafter, for we shall not deserve the sympathy, or pity, of those kind friends who relieved us this year, for they will soon tire of such work, laudable though it has been, and it would become an abuse, if it encouraged idleness or sloth on our part. ."
"Next week, we will give instruction for growing the different cabbages for next"
"464  season's use; and, until the period arrives for the general sowing, get in turnips whenever it is possible to sow them. Remember, they were 50s. a ton last year; and, as we have often said, 20 to 30 tons per acre may be expected from a sowing made yet, which, at the low price of 10s. per ton, would be worth £10 to £15 per acre."
"THE POTATO CROP Editorial - Farmers Gazette, July 10°"", 1847, pages 169-170"
"WE still hear flying reports of the potato crop being diseased, but have not seen a single crop, in all we have inspected, that we would for a moment pronounce dis- ease to such an extent as should create alarm beyond that of a salutary warning that - we should never again trust to the frail root, nor to any other single crop, as the sole food, or the greater proportion of the food of the people. We see at every market we visit throughout the country, as fine, healthy, and as wholesome tubers as ever we saw at this season of the year. We see healthy tubers in every field we inspect, even under the stalks represented as diseased. How different the case this year to what the appearances and effects of the diseases of other years; yet some silly young men, and more silly old, half-educated botanists, will tell us they have ""found the disease in its different stages,"" as if they knew anything at all about it in any stage."
"We saw in the Saunders News-letter, a few mornings back, a notice of fine potatoes exhibited at the Kells show, and represented as a variety got from Mr. Fergus Farrell, seed-merchant in this city. Knowing that Mr. Farrell was in the habit of growing a great variety of the best potatoes, viz..—Sedan's Early Frame, Shilling's Early, Early Shaws, Ash-leaved Kidney, Early Oxford, Prince Regent, Cups, Early Gravesend, &c., on a kind of model, or rather test farm that he has in this county, we went to see his crops, and to ascertain if his potatoes were affected in any manner similar to those represented, as diseased, by his next-door neighbour; but, to our great satisfaction, amongst all the varieties grown by him, not a single plant did we see that we would pronounce diseased, but, on the contrary, the entire presenting a most healthy, luxuriant appearance, except such as we could see any year, one perhaps in five hundred, a little curled, yet these few curled stalks had good-sized and perfectly healthy tubers under them."
"His system of growing potatoes is somewhat peculiar, taking into account the rage for drill husbandry. He has found, from experience, that his crops do better on the . libelled system called “lazy-bed,"" and he finds his wheats succeed better after the lazy-beds than after the ordinary drilling system. This he accounts for by the circumstance of his subsoiling even the furrow of the lazy-bed, and thereby bringing up the dormant ingredients of the subsoil, which, when exposed to the action of the atmosphere, supplies some of the most desirable food for the wheat plants. His object in thus subsoiling at first, was to effect a sort of cheap drainage, stones being scarce and dear, and tiles much dearer when he commenced his improvements; but since tiles became a little cheap, he has drained with them to some extent, setting at defiance the fixed or un-fixed rules of Smith and Parkes."
"O  His drains are from three to four feet deep, composed of tiles and broken stones. The drains run without much regard to order; his rule being to put a drain wherever he found water, or wherever he thought the drain could catch water."
"His draining, however perfect he may have found it, will not be looked on as a model by modern drainers, but his crops are such as a farmer could calculate on paying the rent from, which is, after all, what a// would wish for."
PROSPECTS AND PRECAUTIONS
"Editorial - Farmers Gazette, July 17"", 1847, pages 184-185"
"OUR numerous reports from the different parts of the country all speak highly favourable of the crops in general, but of the potato in particular, with a few exceptions. These exceptions are from Cork, Clogheen, Strabane, Larne, and Monalty. Against these unfvourable reports we have forty-nine of the most flattering kind. But if we had but one unfavourable report and that that one was from a doubtful or suspicious character (the very opposite of those gentlemen.) and we had ninety-nine from the most respectable In Ireland, all corroboratie of what we have seen ourselves of the most favourable kind, both as regards the leaves, stems, tubers, and rootlets, we must still continue to implore of each and every member of society to place no reliance whatever on the potato crop this year, or ever again, except, as we have already often said, as a vegetable to be used as a luxury amongst the rich, or a mere change of diet amongst the middling or lower classes; for it ultimately must come to that, no matter what sacrifices be made of our feelings, propensities, and prejudices. 'Let no one trust to the potato a single hour, no matter how luxuriant its appearance, as the next one may leave it a mass of rottenness to pollute the atmosphere. Its very luxuriant appearance and precocity of habit, both as regards the stems and tubers this year may render it, as It did last year, a more ready prey to the destroying element, should it again visit us. On last Sunday morning, about 3 o'clock, we have reason to believe that in Dublin there occurred some extraordinary electric changes, followed, at 5 o'clock, by the heaviest rain we have for some time seen. When we first heard it we thought it a tremendous hail shower; yet the atmosphere was sultry to an almost insufferable degree. On the same day we had a letter from a relative in Glasgow, - who happened to be up watching at the bed of a sick son; this letter stated that the writer experienced something of a similar character on the previous Thursday night. On Monday we repaired to the country as usual, expecting to see some damage done, not only to the potatoes, but some of the corn crops; we were agreeably surprised to find that those changes, whose effects we dreaded, were confined principally to Dublin, where it does not as yet appear any mischief has been done, at least as far as our reports go. Nevertheless, we still repeatt our most earnest warning fo ail, to trust not an instant to the potato, but to crop their lands, wherever possible to do so, with something else; and if the fatal stroke should come, cut down the stalks at once, raise fresh earth over the drills or beds, in which immature tubers may be, and where the tubers are in a forward state to send them to market. Of course the advice regards the markets is merely for the consideration of men whose better judgment must be their best guide. Dale's hybrid turnips can"
"466  be still sown with every hope of success, and in sowing them, a few grains swedes and Aberdeens should be mixed with them, as very many persons last year had Swedes that stood till the middle of last May, from a crop, the seed for which was sown as late as the middle of July."
"THE POTATO Farmers Gazette, July 24"", 1847, page 198"
"Mr. Long read a paper on the disease in the potato. In his paper Mr. Long, who said that he had paid particular attention to the subject, gave it as his opinion that the disease was the consequence of certain noxious influences created by the comet of 1844, and in support of his theory, he referred to the fact that the disease had not only appeared in the following year, 1843, in the potato in the country, but had more or less manifested itself in almost all other vegetables in Europe, America, and all parts of the world. He also stated, in support of his views, that the disease was impregnated through the haulm, and was by that means communicated to the root and stem of the potato. This theory was, however, disputed, and it was contended that not only had not the disease appeared in the wheat and other crops of 1845, which it would have done if the disease arose from the motion and influence of the heavenly bodies, but that the disease did not appear to be imbibed by any impregnation communicated by means of the haulm, and specimens were produced, which showed that the haulm was in a perfectly healthy state, while the fibres to which the roots were attached were diseased."
AGRICULTURAL CROPS AND PROSPECTS
"Editorial - Farmers Gazette, July 31°', 1847, page 217"
"We have again to thank our kind friends throughout the country for the vast amount of valuable statistical information, especially as regards the crops, received since our last publication."
"That fears are entertained regarding the amount of produce from this season's potato crop, is what we have been always prepared to expect, and hence it is that we always wished our readers, and the public generally, to trust not to it, no matter how abundantly planted, nor how flattering the appearance, at any one particular time, may have been. The fact is we must make up our minds to produce some other wholesome character, and whatever that food may be, it cannot be worse than ""the dry potato.""* This year potato planting commenced at a period that hitherto would have been considered much too early to produce abundant crops, because from such plantings crops were subject to ""the blast,"" as it was termed in the days of our boyhood. This."" blast"" generally occurred in"
"O  very dry seasons, alternating much in heat and cold. That this season was so, we need but look back to the month of May, when hail and sunshine by day and frost at night, were our general visitants; that it has been so to a very late period, we have but to remember that occurred during the nights of Friday and Saturday, the 16th and 17th instant; that situations should suffer, from frost at night followed bya strong sunshine by day, was what every practical man should expect; and that other crops, more or less tender, should to some extent have the same fate, is equally certain. That potatoes should suffer when growing on land completely ex- hausted of moisture, as very many of our potato fields are at the present time, can be well understood by all men in possession of agricultural knowledge; and that they should assume a yellowish, dark, and diseased appearance, is equally well understood; and that the tubers should be diseased from these surface causes, is what we were prepared to expect, yet strange as it may appear, excellent and healthy tubers are to be found under diseased plants, as some well-meaning men are pleased to call them, this year's every-day-experience has fully proved to us, but whether they shall remain long so is another question, and one which it is not our purpose at present to discuss; our business is to guard against the worst, which we are doing, and we advise every one else who will, to be guided by our example."
"We are now using those comparatively matured potatoes where necessary, and preparing to store those not required for immediate consumption. We are not going to hold them over either for sale or to be used as food for working men, but we are in hopes of preserving them as delicacies for those who can afford to use something better beside them, and as fast as the work proceeds we are sowing turnips in their stead. Again; we are cutting off all the stalks that either have performed their natural functions, or that are rendered incapable of performing any more, and we are raising fresh earth on the drills and beds, and sowing turnips there also. These turnips and potatoes we hope to have removed, at latest, before the middle of November, and wheat sown in their place. As long as the potato stalks hold their green, healthy colour, we will allow them to remain; and as late as the first week in August, we will continue to sow turnips, say the Green Dutch or Early Stone, to be also removed in time for wheat-sowing. We are sowing cabbages, to be planted out in September and October, to be used in the late parts of winter, and early in spring, to be followed by beans, peas, carrots, parsnips, or mangel wurzel, and, perhaps, in some instances, by corn crops, where circumstances may deem such culture advisable. Thus it will be seen that we prac- tise as we preach. Such as approve of our course can do likewise, and such as -can do better will have our thanks, and, we might add, the thanks of the country, by making us acquainted with their system."
"Many reports reach us from interested men, whose opinions we take for what they are worth, and no more, and from disinterested honest friends, whose opinions we highly esteem, all giving proofs of something being wrong in the potato crops in some places. We have not seen one single diseased crop this season, although reports were circulated that our own were diseased. These reports are false, as we believe many others to be, founded on ignorance, if not something worse. We never saw them sounder nor sweeter; yet we are prepared to meet ""the stroke,"" or ""blast,"" should it please Providence so to visit us. We watch them ourselves as much as we can spare time to do, and there are others not less watchful in"
"468  our absence, who will soon pounce on them if they show symptoms of failure, cut off the stalks, raise fresh earth, and sow turnip seed, or plant cabbages in their stead. We calculate this year on being able to raise the principal crop totally in September; and where it is designed to sow oats or barley in spring on the potato land, that we intend planting cabbages in September or October; but where wheat must be sown, we will sow the seed early, and by that means save half, if not three-fourths of the seed usually sown on such land. This we will do, pretty confident of success, encouraged by past experience; and we can now add, that, perhaps, in Great Britain, there are few finer wheat crops than we have, free from disease of every kind, about the cultivation of which there was no mystery, no steeping, no doctoring, beyond a careful selection of the seed, cultivating the"
"land well and deeply, and, above all, not giving too much seed. We make no —"
"boast of this: there are hundreds of other practical friends throughout the country who can say the same, and even more than we can. Need we then fear the loss of the potato? we do no such thing:, and, in conclusion, we will just say, the man"
"who will suffer next year from the potato failure, will just meet the reward he will have earned, and for whom there should be no pity, beyond that due to his physical and mental condition, owing, perhaps, to circumstances over which he had no control."
"THE POTATO PANIC—GROUNDLESS FEARS OF IMMEDIATE DANGER Editorial - Farmers Gazette, July 31°', 1847, page 218"
"SINCE our leading remarks on the crops were written, we were led to understand that the disease had set in dangerously at the residence of Dr. Gregory, proprietor of an asylum for respectable gentlemen of weak minds, at Finglas-bridge, near this city. To ascertain the correctness of the report, we went out to see and judge for ourselves; and in a few isolated cases discovered plants with withered leaves and blotched stems, likely to break off by very little force; yet under these, as some gall diseased stems, we found as fine and as sound potatoes as we ever saw— several of them weighing nearly 1 Ib. each—whilst the potato crop, as a whole, presents a most healthy appearance, taking into account the exceedingly dry state of the land, the dry state of the atmosphere generally, coupled with the circumstance of our late frosts at night. His steward, Mr. Dillon, a most intelligent and industrious man, told us he intended advising as we do, the pulling up of the stalks, and sowing turnips over the tubers if such a number of stalks became diseased, as would render it worth while to do so. We saw parsnips there from a crop sown last October, fully 18 inches long, and some of them weighing 1 Ib. at this early season. Now, supposing that these parsnips were in drills 18 inches apart, and at six inches in the drills, there would be over 37 tons per acre, at one- fourth the price that such sold for last year in Carlow and other places (£12 per ton), the case would be thus —374 fons, at £3, £112 10s. per acre. Well, say 20 tons per acre, at £2 per ton, value £40 per acre, which, at least, might be expected on any medium soil well treated and in a good situation, what crop of potatoes would be equal to it in an ordinary season ?"
"We saw flat Dutch cabbages there at three feet apart every way, which, we would"
"O  say, from their present appearance, will average in weight, before next Christmas7 21 Ibs. each, but say 14 Ibs. each, the produce will be 49 tons per acre, at £1 per ton, £49. Sound cabbages for cattle feeding in an ordinary season, should be worth 50 per cent. more. We saw, also, nonpareil cabbages, now perfectly headed the second time (the first cut last March), and each head, we are satisfied, would average 4 Ibs., exclusive of the loose leaves. Thus, a crop of such cabbages, planted at 2 ft. 7.5 inches asunder between the drills, and 18 inches apart in the drills, at the low weight of 3.5 Ibs. each, the weight per acre would be 28 tons, as a second cutting, in the course of the summer and spring. Who would not plant cabbages and, above all, who would not cultivate green crops by spade husbandry, as is done at Dr. Gregory's and other places we could name? We saw, also, in the fields, some of the finest Swedish turnips we have seen this year, and grown after a crop of winter vetches, and wheat now nearly fit for the sickle, a perfectly healthy crop, standing nearly 7 feet high; and we brought in a bean plant of the Windsor variety, measuring 8 feet high, and well podded. Specimens of all these productions can be seen at our office. We cannot conclude without praising the healthy appearance of this fine establishment for the purposes designed, and offering our honest approval of the excellent manner in which Dr. Gregory's crops are grown, both in the gardens and on the farm, by Mr. Dillon; and in this we are borne out by the opinion of Mr. Tighe, a respectable and intelligent young man, to whom we are indebted for accompanying us to the place."
"We have been favoured with a specimen of splendid potatoes from Mr. John Finlayson, the intelligent steward to D. H. Sherrard, Esq., of Thorndale, county of Dublin. They are of the variety called French Whites, much resembling the ""Quarries"" grown in the south of Ireland."
HARVEST CROPS AND PROSPECTS

"Potatoes we have left for last, not because we would undervalue them as a crop, if not abused. No; they are, of all other vegetables, those which we like best; but the ruin their failures have brought on the country will stare us in the face till the day of our death. This year, no matter how good they are or may be reported to be, we cannot calculate on anything from them beyond having seed, which it may hereafter turn out we shall be much better without; we then say, depend not on them, either now or hereafter; this is our oft repeated warning which we hope our friends will take in a becoming spirit."
"POTATO HARVESTING Editorial - Farmers Gazette, September 11th'"", 1847, page 309 ALTHOUGH the potato crop in Ireland is but a bagafelle compared in extent to former years; and although most people are at last disposed to dispense with"
"the potato as a crop henceforward to be abused, and as there are a good"
"470  many acres of excellent potatoes in Ireland now fit to be dug, as the Irish call the process, or /ifted, as our Scotch friends say, we wish to offer a few words in reply to a series of questions put to us during the last three weeks on the subject. All former practices in this respect we will now look on as comparatively obsolete. Be that as it may, they are too well known to require from us any special remark beyond this, that as many, if not most of them, have proved unsuccessful in preserving the crop, it is useless to advert to them. Altered circumstances require altered modes of action. Whether the tubers this year be at all diseased to a greater or less extent in peculiar situations we are not going to discuss, as all must know how their own crops stand. One thing is quite certain, that if any tubers be diseased, exposure to the action of the atmosphere will hasten that decomposition; and hence the supposition, for it is yet but a supposition, that the tubers kept better in the ground fast year than those taken up and housed or pitted. We would therefore advise all who have potatoes growing on dry land, not designed for the autumn sowing of wheat, to pull off their stalks and cover up the drills or beds, so as to preserve the crops from excessive wet or frosts during the winter months."
"Be it observed, that many people lost their potatoes last year by not covering them sufficiently against wet and frosts, so if, in taking the hint we now give, they shall be exposed to the same danger, let them not blame us for it, for we only to advise the covering up, and not immediate digging, where the crop can be secured against frosts and wet, whether the wet proceeds from above or below. To those who require their lands for autumn wheat, or whose lands are wet, we recommend their doing what we are doing, or about to do ourselves —namely, to take up their crops as soon as possible, whilst the weather is dry, the days long, and the sun sufficiently strong to harden the tubers, as they are called. Unripe potatoes require this sunning or greening more than any others; but neither sunning nor anything else can restore to soundness any potatoes at all diseased; and the circumstance of having a few diseased potatoes this year is no proof whatever of the disease of last year being in existence, as we have often seen potatoes, grown on dry lea-land, similarly affected; and the term used in describing the disease we allude to is well known, in parts of the province of Connaught, as ""moss burnt."" We have seen hundreds of barrels of potatoes so affected, in the county of Roscommon, many years ago; and I to such an extent have we seen such crops affected, that the growers left them under ground sooner than that they should become subject to the conacre rent. How little our philosophic botanists know of these things! But to our harvesting. This year an abundance of dry earth, dry sand, dry turf-mould, or other dry material can be had, and should be used, where necessary, amongst the tubers, to keep them from being too much in contact with each other, which would produce fer- mentation, and hasten decomposition. We are preserving all our small potatoes for seed, not that we intend ever again to plant so extensively, even supposing we can keep this year's crop as sound as we could desire, but because we wish to have some to dispose of to those who may have but little, or perhaps none at all. As we take up the crop we separate the large tubers for consumption, and the slightly small ones for seed; badly formed or suspicious small ones we give to the pigs as a rarity with their other food;"
"O  as we have house-room enough we are housing all, mixed with such substances as we have already described, making it a point that a sufficient ventilation is secured through the heaps and wails. In all we have said here there is little new, and we merely notice the subject thus early, that our readers may be induced to take time by the forelock, and secure their crops, and at the same time take notice again that should make early arrangements for growing other crops than potatoes."
THE POTATO CROP Meeting of Chemico-Agricultural Society of Ulster
"Farmers Gazette, October 16th"", 1847, page 387"
"Letters were read from members of council, residing in various parts of Ulster, respecting the state of the potato crop. Mr. Golding, of Castleblaney, reported, that, in his neighbourhood, the crop was but slightly injured, antl that the disease did riot appear to increase. A return, made by Dr. M'Kittrick, of Holywood, showed that, in his district, the crop was not good; that the potatoes were every day becoming worse; that the whole grain crop of this year would not be more than sufficient to sustain the labouring population, in lieu of the potato; that, at present, the labouring classes were generally using Indian meal for food; that several fields of potatoes, which, till lately, were considered sound, were now found to be diseased; and that there were no potatoes in the hands of the labouring classes."
"Dr. Orr considered that the potato disease was very irregular in its appearance. In some districts, in his part of the country, it appeared on the increase; in others, to make no progress. The disease of the present year, he thought, resembled that of 1845, in its characters."
"Dr. Kelly stated, that about Donaghadee the disease was certainly not increasing; the French potatoes were most affected. In reply to a question, he stated, that those planted on sea-weed were freer from disease that those grown on farm-yard manure."
"The Chairman reported, that, in the neighbourhood of Greyabbey, the crops were very slightly affected."
"Colonel Young said, that in his neighbourhood, the farmers had remarked, that the potatoes nearest the surface were, in general, safe; which, he believed, was contrary to the observation of former years."
FUNGUS IN POTATO STALKS Meeting of Chemico-Agricultural Society of Ulster
"Farmers Gazette, October 16th"", 1847, page 387"
"Dr. Hodges brought under the notice of the meeting specimens of the substance which Mr. William Marshall had described, at the last meeting of council, as presenting the appearance of ergot of rye. They were found in the interior of"
"472  stalks that were decaying : frequently the upper part of the stalk was quite sound; but, when these substances were observed, it had an unhealthy appearance. On opening the stalk, a number of small black substances are observed, some of them spherical and others angular, embedded in the stalk, and covered over with a white down. Where the ergot was embedded, the sides of the stalk appeared there as oat straw. The tubers, at the roots of the diseased stalks, were healthy. :"
"Mr. Marshall gave an account of the circumstances connected with the appearance of these little bodies. He asked Dr. Hodges's opinion of their nature, in consequence of a statement made by a writer in the FARMERS' GAZETTE."
"Dr. Hodges stated, that the writer of the letter alluded to, had evidently confounded those fungoid bodies with the buds of the potato. [Dr. Hodges here exhibited to the meeting specimens of the potato buds ; and, also, of the supposed ergot.] He said that he would request the Rev. Mr. Berkley, well known for his researches in that department of natural history, to give them information on the subject."

"POTATO PLANTING AND STORING Farmers Gazette, October 16th'"", 1847, page 395"
"siR—Having found the plan I practised last year in storing and planting potatoes equally successful this year, agreeable to your wishes, I send a detailed account of it."
"When raising the general crop of potatoes, I prefer selecting item it the seed for the next year, and for this purpose choose the middle-sized tubers. I find they make the best seed. After being collected they are to be dusted over with fresh-slaked lime in powder, and then stored in the following way :—Lay off beds 4 feet wide, with alleys of 2 feet from the surface of the beds, with a roller, or the back of the spade; lay on the beds an inch of peat in depth, if to be had; if not, dry mould will answer, but 1 prefer the peat; and use it as fine as possible for the purpose of excluding the air, which is a matter, I consider, of great importance, for I remarked, since the present disease of the potato plant, when the tubers were exposed to the action of the air, they invariably turned black, whilst the portions of the same crop that remained covered, were perfectly sound. On the layer of peat place one of potatoes, so that the potatoes do not touch each other ; then another layer of peat, and so on till the pit or clamp is finished, with a narrow top in the usual way, but there are not so many potatoes to be put on each other as heretofore. When first I tried this way, I put only one layer of potatoes, but since I store them in the way at present described, arid I fincl it to answer. ""WIi4n tii<3 pit is finished, it is to be earthed over to the depth of 12 inches, at least; not so much for the purpose of guarding against the effects of frost, as to keep the temperature as'low as possible, and the cooler the place in which potatoes"
"O  are stored, the better, provided it is dry. Houseing potatoes, I find objectionable, from the reasons already stated. In this situation, the potatoes remain till the month of February, at which time they are to be planted ; the sets are not to be cut, but planted whole. I prefer planting at this early period of the season, that the seed may be in the ground before it begins to germinate. Persons who might find it inconvenient to follow this course with their general planting, might do so with the portion of the crop intended for seed."
"By storing the seed as described and planting at the time mentioned, or as near to it as possible, the advantages of autumn planting are attained, and the casualties attending it are not to be contended with."
"My experience for a course of years in autumn planting, warrants me in saying it is not adapted for this country ; its great humidity is opposed to it. I do not apprehend any injury, once wintered, from frost, even when it is most severe ; a reasonable course of mould will protect the seed from its effects, and even if the seed is frozen in the ground, I find it .does not sustain injury. But, in a season of wet, unless in very dry soils, the seed is destroyed from an excess of moisture. Again, the sorts of potatoes generally cultivated in this country, do not answer the purposes of autumn planting, a circumstance many have entirely overlooked, who recommend potatoes to be planted in autumn—"
"Yours, &¢., JOHN J. GEOGHEGAN, Thomastown, Co, Tipperary, September 29, 1847."
"[We are much obliged to our correspondent for his communication, notwithstanding there is nothing novel in what he recommends in storing potatoes, as those who have read our pages, must be aware. Whilst there is something rather objectionable as to the time of planting, especially as regards those designed to produce seed. If potato planting ever again becomes general in Ireland, and if it be ever expected to produce as heavy crops, and leave the land in as good tilth, with the least pos- sible expense, as formerly, the best time for planting the general crop will be as formerly, from the middle of April to the 12th of May, as this year has proved it. The best time to plant potatoes to produce seed, is from the middle of May to the middle of June ; but discussions on potato planting are but a waste of time, till we know more of the cause of the disease, by which the crops have been swept off; and even when we will know more of the causes, we may still doubt our power to prevent them, so as to ward off their effects.]"
POTATOES
"Farmers Gazette, October 16th"", 1847, page 395"
"sSiIR—In May last I addressed to you a letter, pointing out that by taking off the shoots or offsets, but one, from the potato plants, and transplanting them carefully, the produce might be greatly increased. I now have the satisfaction of stating, that having done so myself, I have had from four to seven good-sized potatoes from each offset, and more than quadrupled the produce. The parent plant has been strengthened, and the effect has been, that the potatoes are all"
"474  of a good, marketable size, and no small ones. From several individuals who have adopted the same plan, I have been informed of the same result."
"Considering this an important fact, worthy of being made known extensively, I request you will insert this letter in your paper."
"I may add, that in August I put down cuttings of potato-stalks, taken above a foot from the ground, and from every one I have a well-formed potato. I placed"
"three of these cuttings, with the potatoes to them, in the Museum of the Royal Dublin Society for public inspection.—"
