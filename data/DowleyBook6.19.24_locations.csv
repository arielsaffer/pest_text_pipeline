"In the middle of the eighteenth century agriculture in Ireland was very backward and tillage played a subservient role to grazing. This was further aggravated by the system of land tenure. In the late 18"" century, most of the land in Ireland was in the hands of the landed gentry. The estates were normally managed by the landlords agents who were responsible for renting most of the land to middlemen, large - farmers, smaller farmers and cottiers. In general, the farmers produced grain which they gave to the landlord in lieu of the rent. Potatoes, milk, beef, poultry and pork were sold or used on farm. Currency, as we know it to-day, was not in normal use by farmers or labourers. The very small farmers produced only potatoes and pigs. The pigs in this situation were used to pay the landlord.

"were not “absentee landlords” and only a few, whether absentee or otherwise were “pad” landlords. The fact that nearly ail landlords were anglo-saxon and protestant would not have helped their public profile or endeared them to their catholic tenants. It is highly probable that the current day “landlords” are as bad as those during the famine period, except on a much smaller scale. The famine resulted in rents not being paid while at the same time the cost of providing relief fell largely on the landlord. This eventually lead to the bankruptcy of many landlords and the eventual redistribution of land in Ireland.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"In 1758 the Irish Parliament made its first real effort to promote tillage.

"I spent all of my working life (1964-2008) engaged in potato research at Oak Park Research Centre in Carlow.

"Dr. Macdonald then read a paper by Mr. Bobert Boyd, Innerleithen, Peebles- shire, on the prevention of the curl in the potato, and on the best method of keeping potatoes intended for seed. Mr. Boyd says that he has been more troubled with the curl in the potato than with any other disease to which the plant is liable. For ten years a portion of his garden invariably produced curled potatoes, though the seed was annually changed, and not unfrequently the manure itself. On examining the tubers of the curled plants, he invariably found them affected with the wire-worm, or a small slug or snail, and although he dusted the sets with quicklime, not a single not a single plant was produced free of curl. He next dipped the sets in a mixture of salt and water, and dusted them with quicklime,and though the crop fell short of average, it was nearly double that produced by the sets not dipped in the saline solution. Next year, on the sets beind dipped in a solution of lime, salt and water, gave a satisfactory result, both in regard of freeness of disease and extent of produce. As to keeping of potatoes for seed, Mr. Boyd tried the planting of potatoes which had unintentionally been left in the field all winter in comparison with those which had been pitted in the usual way, the seed, the soil, the manure being alike, and the result was, that the plants from the sets which had","['Peebles- shire', None, 'Peebles- shire, Ireland']","Peebles, Currabubula, Liverpool Plains Shire Council, New South Wales, 2342, Australia",farm,-31.2801567,150.6874969,"['-31.2901567', '-31.2701567', '150.6774969', '150.6974969']"

"IN last, week's paper we had the pleasure to copy from a Scottish cotemporary a report, amongst other matters, of the highly interesting discussion which took place at one of the forenoon meetings of the Scottish Agricultural Chemistry Association, in Glasgow, on the subject of potato failures. This meeting had been announced for some time, some very eminent agriculturists attended it, and nothing can batter show the exceeding difficulty of the question mooted—viz., What is the cause of the potato failures, and is there a remedy for them ?—than the discrepancy of opinion advanced on the occasion. The general opinion of scientific agriculturists appears to be, that there is a liability inherent in every plant which has for a long period been cultivated in the same soil to become deteriorated, hence the universal belief in the advantage of "" changing the seed ;"" and that, in the case of the potato, the most likely means of avoiding failure would be, to procure a new generation of plants from seed (not tubers) of a healthy crop; but in the discussion to which we are referring, Mr. Girdwood's experience gave the death-blow, in limine, to this cherished opinion—the seedlings (whether raised from a healthy or tainted crop is not stated, however) were found to be as liable to decay as any others.","['Glasgow', None, 'Glasgow, Ireland']","Glasgow, Glasgow City, Alba / Scotland, G2 1DY, United Kingdom",city,55.861155,-4.2501687,"['55.7011550', '56.0211550', '-4.4101687', '-4.0901687']"

"SiR - The cause of the failure in the potato, as you observe in last week's remarks on the meeting of the Scottish Agricultural Chemistry Association, lately held in Glasgow, appears to be as yet a secret. Of the immediate effect, however, of that cause, there seems to be room for little diversity of opinion. The nearest cause to which we can trace the failure, though evidently no more than a secondary one, appears’ to be a lack of moisture or juices in the seed, eventuating in dry rot, immediately after being committed to the ground. As proof of this, a coarse or green tuber seldom refuses to grow, even when cut and planted early, or indeed at any time as far as my experience or accurate information has hitherto extended; while, on the other hand, such as are dry or mealy are apt not to grow luxuriantly, and often not at all, if cut and planted in dry weather, or late in the season.","['Glasgow', None, 'Glasgow, Ireland']","Glasgow, Glasgow City, Alba / Scotland, G2 1DY, United Kingdom",city,55.861155,-4.2501687,"['55.7011550', '56.0211550', '-4.4101687', '-4.0901687']"

Besides, we know not how he treated his ground, his seed, his manure, or how he timed or tided his operations; and as we would be thankful even for imperfect remedies, before condemning any hint, we should be sure that an unsuccessful experiment, particularly when it stands in opposition to a number of successful ones, has been made with a sufficiency of skill, attention, means, &e., and that the statement implies neither more nor less than what is definitely expressed; and, particularly, that the individual be not something of what I am myself at this present moment — a stickler for some specific remedy, totally different from the one he condems.

He is particular in the shape of his seed, so am |; I dislike a deep eye as a table potato as is difficult to clean and wasteful. I do not see the absolute necessity of changing the seed. My principal crop consists of two sorts, the seed of which I have not changed these seven years—the early, a round, white potato, and Jersey, a late, mealy, and prolific reddish oval potato. Last year I exchanged a sack with a friend at six miles' distance for one of his, from seed procured the year before from Jersey, and planted in order to try the effect of the change in the same manner. The result was, the old seed produced twelve measures, when the new only produced eight. Morton says the seed has not been changed on the Stincheomhe farm for many years—if I remember right, thirty. I have tried many sorts, generally some new one every year, but find after two or three years, they want changing, not being suited to the soil.

The soil in which they had grown had _Stained them with a brownish black colour. Of the two varieties from Hamburg, one was white, the other pink; and that from Holland was white. They were planted in two fields, occupying in all fully a Scotch acre, in a manner precisely similar to the potatoes of this country. The Hamburg pink almost entirely rotted in the ground. The two white varieties manifested at first an unfavourable appearance, sending up puny shoots— every eye, however, sent, up a shoot— and as most of the tubers had been planted whole, and the people, fearing to lose the crop, from their smallness, insisted on planting two together, and the number of shoots that came up crowding together, showed at once that the crop had been too closely planted. After the stems had risen about two feet they interlaced in the drills, and presented a surface of uniform levelness, and at length towered far above the common varieties in the same field. The Dutch white exhibited a white blossom, with a few seed-apples; the Hamburg white, a beautifully purple .and highly odorous blossom but no seed-apples. The leaves of the Dutch sort had fallen, while those of the Hamburg remained vigorous and green when the crop was taken up.

"The next paper by Mr. Joseph Smeal, gardener to the Earl of Morton, at Dalmahoy, was read by Mr. J. Hall Maxwell, younger, of Dargavel. The potatoes intended for seed are taken out of the ground by Mr. Smeal in the beginning of September, or earlier if the crop is sufficiently matured, and spread upon the surface of the ground, where they remain exposed to the sun and weather till such time as they become quite green in colour, and of a soft, spongy consistence. This will be effected in the course of a month or sir weeks, during which time they -must be turned at least once, and which can easily be done with a wooden rake. The greening process is much forwarded by sunshine, but it is desirable in all cases to have the potatoes lifted in sufficient time to allow the process to be com- pleted before the frost sets in; though Air. Smeal has observed, that potatoes so treated are less liable to be affected by frosts than the others, or to be attacked by vermin and insects when stored, on account of the bitter disagreeable taste they contract. The prepared potatoes may be stored in pits or houses in the usual way. Tk« a,-.»t »J»«,,tnsc of ihis method or preparing seed potatoes, according to Mr. Smeal, is the certainty of a good and early crop. The potatoes may be planted whole, and the small ones selected to save expense; but, if the latter be preferred, they had better be prepared by cutting a piece off one end ""in the autnnra, to afford time for the wound to heal, and to aToid a redundancv of","['aToid', None, 'aToid, Ireland']",,,,,
"Mr. Finnie of Swanston remarked that however well Mr. Smeal's recommendation might suit the culture of the garden, he apprehended that it was inapplicable to the field culture of the potato; as in the field the crop was seldom fit to be raised until the latter half of October, when the risk of frost rendered the exposure of potatoes for a month or six weeks, before they could become sufficiently green, an eminently dangerous experiment. Independently of frost, the large qua ntity of seed-potato required to plant from twenty to forty acres of land, could not be exposed on a field at that late season of the year, without risking the inability to carry them off the field in wet weather, should it set in. And, besides, the occupa- tion of the land by the seed under the proposed process of preparation would prevent its being seed-furrowed for wheat. The greening of seed potatoes may be an effectual remedy against failure; but he did not perceive how the farmer could avail himself of the proposal.","['Swanston', None, 'Swanston, Ireland']","Swanston, City of Edinburgh, Alba / Scotland, United Kingdom",hamlet,55.8932191,-3.2170207,"['55.8888547', '55.8956657', '-3.2224797', '-3.2132948']"

"very well for placing along and through the pits to give a free current of air, so essential to their preservation. When a change of seed is desirable, it would be advisable that the farmer or his manager should inspect the pits from which they are intended to be taken, to ascertain how they have been kept.

They are expected to be ready for the market about the end of June, when the ground will be re-ridged and planted with Swedish turnips, having good plants ready for the purpose.

"O  have the harrow so constructed as to stop at regular intervals to drop any weeds collected, which are afterwards carried off for bedding, which, at that season of the year, is sometimes not too plenty. When this stands two or three days, to kill any weeds, I then commence with my convertible grubber a description of which appeared in the GAZETTE of 15th of 6th month (June, 1844), and which, in my opinion, is the best adapted for general agricultural purposes of anything of the kind I ever met with,—although I have examined several of the most extensive agricultural implement manufactories in Ireland.—both for strength, improved form of teeth, its being convertible into so many different purposes, &c., at a small additional expense. The first cost of the implement itself now, since the rise in the price of iron, would be, for two horses, about £3, for three horses, £3 15s. As some of thy correspondents were inquiring about grubbers some time ago, I have been induced to make these observations. I may further add, that an acquaintance of mine near Dublin has applied to me to procure him one, which can be applied to the purposes of potato harrow, scuffle, drill grubber, common grubber, wheat drill, and double mould-board plough. It can also be applied to striping and putting up potatoes at the one operation, and at one going through; and, lastly, in my opinion one of its very best points, it is uncommonly well adapted for the purpose of a subsoil-plough for two, three, or even four horses, in all soils that are not much infested with large stones. To this last point I could not speak so positively last year, not having had much trial of it at that time; but it is my opinion that in soils of the abode description three horses will do the work almost as well as five, and decidedly better than four, with the subsoil-plough—of course having two or three horses opening with the common plough. When it is made, I intend to request my friend to show it to thee, as the model which I sent up was but an imperfect one, having to be made in such a hurry. The cost of the above would be about £5 or £6, or perhaps a little more, in consequence of the rise in the price of iron.","['Dublin', None, 'Dublin, Ireland']","Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, Éire / Ireland",city,53.3493795,-6.2605593,"['53.2987342', '53.4105416', '-6.3870259', '-6.1148829']"

"siR—I have been for some days in the early part of this week with a friend in the country; and in our walks through his farm, observed a field of, I suppose, three acres, planted with Bangor potatoes, in lazy beds; it had been an old lea, and the potatoes were planted before Christmas, manured with sea-rock. My attention was directed particularly to this field, by observing two men raking the surface of the ridges into the furrows. I remarked to my friend—"" You, of course, intend that all the soil now removed by the rake, shall again be replaced by the shovel. His reply was—"" By no means, as that description of potato, not growing to the surface like the pink eye and cup potato, does not require to be second covered."" This mode of culture being so different from what I had been accustomed to with regard to potatoes, determined me to make you acquainted with it, in hopes that should it be the best mode of culture, you would, by publishing this letter, give information to others on the subject; or if the contrary, you would draw attention to it in your next publication, in such a manner as may promote the object you have so constantly in view, namely, the improvement of husbandry in general.—","['Bangor', None, 'Bangor, Ireland']","Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine, 04401, United States",city,44.8016255,-68.7713289,"['44.7775455', '44.8801777', '-68.8590412', '-68.7187359']"

The first symptom of degeneracy of the plant in Scotland appeared about the year 1780, when the distemper, called the curl, first exhibited itself but it then oc- curred so rarely, that very little notice was taken of it; but the evil gradually and extensively increased, when, about the year 1784-5, the whole crops of the Lothians were seriously affected by it. A remedy, however, was accidentally discovered, by changing the seed from the high country; and this was, and has been, the only remedy for the disease of the curl to the present day. At this early period, the seed procured from the high country had to be changed every three or four years; but it was found, as the cultivation of the plant increased so did this disease; and from about the year 1620 up to the year 1835, it was customary to change the seed every other year; and from 1835, to the present year 1845, the whole seed had to be changed yearly as it was found that a new disease appeared in the fields; the seed only _ partially germinated—great failures took place—and many farmers almost lost their whole crops. This disease in the seed was called the wet and dry rot; and, in many instances, seed from all situations, high and low, has now also failed. Yes, seed from old grass-lands, in a high situation, low temperature -and an excellent crop, and which had never been known to have grown a potato-crop, the produce, as seed, has signally failed; and many instances can be attested where, in newly improved lands, in high situations and which had never been previously been cropped, immense crops of potatoes, has produced but have been found utterly worthless as seed, and the disease always the same, partially curl, and blind eyes as they are producing wet and dry rot. These two kinds of disease which destroy germination, called the wet and dry rot are variously accounted for. Some ascribe the problem to maggots and flies which feed upon and destroy the seed plants; but this is a consequence, and not the cause; for","['Scotland', None, 'Scotland, Ireland']","Alba / Scotland, United Kingdom",state,56.7861112,-4.1140518,"['54.4339831', '61.0610000', '-14.0155170', '-0.3209221']"

"were the many contradictory opinions and statements. The truth is, that blanks in the fields, or partial failures of the crops, were maintained by some to be quite un- accountable, and some of Nature's freaks when she was inclined to be mischievous; such as, part of the crop so different—and planted at different times of the day—one hoar's planting had failed and become blank—while the others were a fair crop, I can easily conceive, however, that degenerate or delicate seed could be easily injured when planted in very dry or wet ground, or by any exposure or variation of temperature. A few drills not covered by the plough, when the weather was too dry, and the plants exposed to the sun and air during the time of the servant's breakfast or dinner, was quite sufficient to produce failures or blanks in the drills. I now cose to state an Instance, and one of many that can be adduced, which most clearly and satisfactorily, supports my assertion, viz., that a heavy crop, grown in any situation or soil, will always be found to produce, in a certain degree, degenerate and tainted seed. The following is a letter which I lately received from Mr. Cunninghame, tenant, Barlow, in the parish of Currie. This farm is situated near the foot of the Pentland Hills, at an elevation of more than 500 feet above the level of the sea. Mr. Cunninghame was born and bred on the farm (his late father being the proprietor). He is well known by his improvements of the plough, &c.; and he is very particular and careful in all his farming operations, taking a great interest in them, personally superintending ail the operations; and I may also add, that his statements can be implicitly depended on. The experiment (if may call it one) may have been more minutely described; but as the broad feature of the case—the cause of failure—is what I aim at, it is of much less importance. It may be asked, how is the failure now so universal under all systems of management, even extending to the uplands ? I answer, that the system of management is now nearly alike in all places, soils and situations, both at home and abroad; that the cultivator of the root finds that excessive manuring produces heavy crops; and the same pernicious system is now followed by the hill-farmers, as many find the seed-trade a profitable one; and the quantity cannot be increased without the requisite stimulus—the dunghill; and the late discovered measures have enabled them to increase their stock of manure for the potato crop.","['the Pentland Hills', None, 'the Pentland Hills, Ireland']","Pentland Hills Regional Park, Penicuik, Midlothian, Alba / Scotland, United Kingdom",protected_area,55.84598805,-3.3076937855677846,"['55.7917336', '55.9002272', '-3.4974943', '-3.1974776']"

"The above completely confirms what I have already advanced, viz., that. a heavy or overgrown crop of potatoes, in any soil or situation, will always yield bad seed potatoes; and that over-cultivation is the -sole or chief cause of the degeneracy of the plant. As an exception to this rule, it is mentioned in the Quarterly Journal of the Highand Society, No. 4, and in the Farmer's Note-Book, No. 4, extracted from a German work, published by Dr. Sprengel “that the cultivation of the potato is one of the principal objects of farming in the vicinity of Hamburgh, and the growing of corn a secondary object; and as this is particularly the casei n Flotbeck, that no such case of failure has occurred. It has happened several times in wet weather that the seed putrefied; and even when the potatoes had not suffered in this way when planted out, not half of them germinated ; while those that did, were sickly and a poor crop.""

It will be found that diseased seed will produce bad or diseased crops; and that near shipping ports the potatoes will be carried, by our shipping and others, in small quantities to all parts of the world; and hence increasing the evil; the more especially as the great bulk of the crop is produced in the highly-cultivated districts where the seed will be most deteriorated. It seems self-evident, then, that the crop first degenerated in the rich and cultivated districts of the low country, producing curl in the plant; that as the cultivation of it increased, the curl increased, and a change of seed was found necessary from the high country; that within these ten years past, in addition to curl, blanks or entire failure of the plant has taken place in our fields, and the disease of curl, and the complete or partial failure, has kept pace with the cultivation of the plant, and in the exact quantity of stimulants or manure applied; and that the first blanks in the fields have appeared to have continued since the manure has been so much increased to the crops viz., during the last years, the quantity of manure applied to the crop having been increased one forth generally all over the country, as the increased quantity of manure (when the crop has succeeded) has in a very remarkable degree increased the return, to the extent, in many cases, of one-third more potatoes; and in some instances the crop has been doubled.

That the plant has continued longer in the hill-districts free of curl and failure, is no argument against my theory, as it is the poverty of the soil and the want of manure that have saved it. it not only has received less manure—for they have little to give it but it has not received at its root so much of that heating and stimulating article, horse-dung or stable-manure, which I attribute as the cause of assisting materially in the deterioration of the root.

"I come now to the cure or remedy of the disease or the best means of procuring and raising good seed—as I do not yet despair of seeing good seed, and the best that can be raised, to be found in the early and highly-cultivated districts.

"earth; and if earth be not previously mixed with the manure, a little may be drawn into the drills above the manure, and before planting the seed. Mr. Dickson Sanghton, near Edinburgh, who has been very successful m raising good crops of potatoes, is very judiciously, this year, mixing all the manure intended for potatoes with earth. The ground intended for seed should be planted with whole potatoes, and about fourteen inches apart; or the potato cut in two, and planted at ten inches (both may be tried), the plants to be placed near the surface, and never highly earthed up by the plough, as it is natural for the tubers of the plant to run upwards; and the more of them, in ripening, that may be exposed to the sun and air (greened), they will make so much the better seen. To be taken up rather green or unripe than other- ‘wise, but approaching to a ripe state. To be placed in pits (in any airy situation), at about 2 and a half feet at bottom: they may be carried up pretty high, and the pits may be made of a tolerable length. They should have first a little earth thrown over them—say half an inch—and then a good covering of straw, finishing with a few inches deep of earth, as it is the straw which will defend them from frost; and a few straw funnels, at short distances, is all that is necessary. The seed potato should be planted by the first of May at farthest. In the late districts, as the seed may be injured by the frost before taken up, they could be well earthed up by the plough a short time before the frost may be expected; and the same may be done ‘in the low country; but of course they do not run an equal risk so early in the season, although we all know that a very slight degree of frost will injure the potato. Those not meant for seed ought to be managed much in the same way; giving the land, however, more manure, and planting’ deeper; as the potato, if greened, will, of course, be unfit for food. I would advise the experiment of topping or cutting the potato tops when too luxuriant. It may be done in this way:—A person, with a common harvest reaping-hook, about the time of the decay of the blossom, should be employed to go along the drills and cut off the tops, about two inches or so below the blossom; this will not only prevent them seeding, but will check the luxuriance of the stems, and save the exhausted roots or tubers. I have always thought that the produce of any overgrown or luxuriant white crop produced inferior seed; and I suspect it will be found that all white and green crops may be too highly cultivated. It is well known that turnip roots rot and decay prematurely from the application of too much manure. I have also long entertained the idea, that smut in wheat, barley, and oats, has always arisen from over- cultivation; and if we shall find out the cause, we can have less difficulty in finding a remedy. I therefore, hope that agriculturists will assist me m exploring the field of over-cultivation, which has seldom or never been thought of, as almost every farmer has gone on upon the principle, that too much stimulus could not be applied: the crop may have been too luxuriant to be profitable, but the degeneracy of the seed or root has been invariably lost sight of. We must, then, bear in mind, that Dame Nature may be assisted or followed with success; but if we shall attempt to deviate from her law, we are sure to fail. :","['Edinburgh', None, 'Edinburgh, Ireland']","City of Edinburgh, Alba / Scotland, United Kingdom",city,55.9533456,-3.1883749,"['55.8187919', '56.0040837', '-3.4495326', '-3.0749528']"

Some of the guano was mixed with turf-mould (about 1 cwt. of guano to 14 cwt. of turf-mould), and some of it was mixed in the same proportion with ashes left after the fires burned in the house (peat and wood).

"[The object of the GAZETTE is, to disseminate knowledge on every point, connected with agriculture, and suited to the varied circumstances in which the farmers and cottagers of this country are placed. The article on the autumn manuring of land, as a preventive of potato failure, is, we think, worthy the consideration of every farmer. It would never do to keep such information from the public, merely because certain circumstances prevent its general adoption. It is true that the small farmer, and cottager, have no manure to put on their land at the time recommended in the article referred to; but still this is no reason why those who have, should be denied the benefit of such information. Were small farmers as provident and careful as they might be, their manure heap would be much larger in autumn than it usually is. It is only by showing the necessity of having a plentiful supply of manure, at all seasons, that we can hope to induce them to use the means to provide themselves with it. Our correspondent would be doing a real service to the extensive class of small farmers in Ireland, could he put them in the way of cultivating potatoes, as successfully as he appears to have done himself, for the last nine years, and we think he can not be a day too soon in giving them the benefit of his experience.]","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

I have reason to think, appearances of disease, of an unusual kind, will be found in many of the tubers on close inspection. I shall now instance two well-known varieties, and endenvour to describe the appearance of the disease as it strikes me. They are the common cup, or “minion"" as it is called in some places, and the common lumper or ""horse-potato,"" as some cail them. In the first there will be ‘found some deep red spots, sometimes near the root end, sometimes near the crown or rose end, and not unfrequently through the greater part of the potato. Tihis is, I think, an early indication of the disease in those parts, which, on further decomposition, will assume a purplish cast, and finally become black. In the lumper, whose colour is different, the first indication is the appearance, on its white skin, of blotches of a cream colour, subsequently yellow and brown, and finally black. There is no time at which these can be so easily detected as when the tubers are just taken up in dry weather; for, an exposure to the light, and the influence of the atmosphere, these marks, in either variety, will be less perceptible. If my opinions be correct, is it too much to request that every man, woman, and child, employed in raising and securing the crop, will have a sharp look out to discover the appearance of disease, and separate the good from the bad, or even suspected. I know not now, after the opinion given by Dr. Herapath, on the subject of lime, as applicable to the storing of potatoes, whether warranted, in recommending it generally for the prevention of the new disease; I will merely say, I am trying it, and if found successful—if an opportunity presents itself—will report the result. I anticipate an objection that may be raised by some good-natured or fastidious friend, which is this—that if in one case I find lime to hasten decomposition, how could I, in the other, recommend the use of it to prevent it ? To this I would reply, in limine: bear in mind, that the lime, effects the of which were decomposition, was caustic,"" "" quick,"" or ""roach lime;"" whilst that which I have found to arrest it was, ""mild"" or ""slaked"" lime, reduced previously to a fine powder.

If my opinions be correct, is it too much to request that every man, woman, and child, employed in raising and securing the crop, will have a sharp look out to discover the appearance of disease, and separate the good from the bad, or even suspected. I know not now, after the opinion given by Dr. Herapath, on the subject of lime, as applicable to the storing of potatoes, whether warranted, in recommending it generally for the prevention of the new disease; I will merely say, I am trying it, and if found successful—if an opportunity presents itself—will report the result. I anticipate an objection that may be raised by some good-natured or fastidious friend, which is this—that if in one case I find lime to hasten decomposition, how could I, in the other, recommend the use of it to prevent it ? To this I would reply, in limine: bear in mind, that the lime, effects the of which were decomposition, was caustic,"" "" quick,"" or ""roach lime;"" whilst that which I have found to arrest it was, ""mild"" or ""slaked"" lime, reduced previously to a fine powder. However, the facts have been as I have endeavoured to state them; and if they be of any value, the public are entitled and welcome to them.","['lumper', None, 'lumper, Ireland']","Lumper, Lumperhof, Albertshofen, Ravensburg, Verwaltungsverband Mittleres Schussental, Landkreis Ravensburg, Baden-Württemberg, 88212, Deutschland",road,47.7732325,9.6316117,"['47.7725882', '47.7747514', '9.6293169', '9.6325533']"

"SIR—As the period is now coming round when the extent of injury sustained by the potato crop will become known, I write to inform you what has been the result of my own observation in a tour which I have just taken through several miles of country between Youghal and Waterford along the sea-coast—a district in which the farmers were congratulating themselves that they had escaped this dreadful affliction; for up to the present month, no appearance of disease had exhibited itself, and the farmer was calculating upon a most plentiful crop. However, within the last few days such hopes have been sadly disappointed: in every field I visited I found the potatoes spotted; and it is apprehended that when put into pits or housed, the injury will extend through all those which now appear sound, and that dearth or famine must be the almost inevitable consequence at the termination of the season. Some persons are disposed to defer digging out the crop until such potatoes as are infected may decay away; while others are laying them in small pits, containing not more than a barrel or two, which they purpose examining from time to time, and removing such as are unfit for use; but the great majority are wholly at a loss to know what to do at such a crisis. If any means have been devised which are calculated to preserve this valuable esculent, you would bestow the most incalculable benefit upon the community by laying it before the public in your esteemed columns; and such information will be most thankfully received by.","['Waterford', None, 'Waterford, Ireland']","Waterford, County Waterford, Munster, Éire / Ireland",city,52.2609997,-7.1119081,"['52.2102427', '52.2798229', '-7.1869522', '-7.0338797']"

"WE continue to receive the most distressing accounts of the potato epidemic, from all quarters of the country. Scarcely a field seems to have escaped; and several farmers who had flattered themselves, from frequent examination of their fields, that all was right, have been astonished at finding the work of destruction begun, and considerably advanced in the course of twenty-four hours after an inspection, from which they had come to the conclusion, that no disease existed in their crop. To add to the terrible disaster which seems to threaten a winter of severe suffering and famine amongst the poorer classes in this country, a similar disease has broken out in the turnip crop. A gentleman from the neighbourhood of Dundalk, called at our office the other day, with a box of Swedish turnips, giving unmistakable evidence, from the odour they exhaled, that they were in an active stage of decomposition.","['Dundalk', None, 'Dundalk, Ireland']","Dundalk, County Louth, Leinster, Éire / Ireland",town,54.0046033,-6.4008879,"['53.9505541', '54.0279323', '-6.4443775', '-6.3415418']"

I am aware that, some time since, inquiries were made, through the constabulary, by government; but the character of the disease is so peculiar, and the mode of its operation so unexpected, that the apparent state of the crop of potatoes a fortnight ago affords very incorrect information as to its real state at the present moment.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"SiB—I regret to say that the disease, whatever it is, has come amongst the potato crop in this locality, and, from all I hear, is, I much fear, very general. The farmers and labourers are in a great state of anxiety; and I really can compare their expressions to nothing but the remembrance of what they endured under the infliction of the cholera. Potatoes being their all, their sole subsistence—if they fail, the people look in terror to a famine. For what has already suffered, there is no remedy; and our only hope is to preserve what may be yet uninfected. From what I have read, and principally in your GAZETTE, I would presume to offer my opinion on the best mode of proceeding now; and I would say, pull (not out) all the stalks, spread from thirty to forty barrels of lime per acre on the crop, and dig out. The hot lime will accelerate decomposition in those affected, and make them more easily known. Separate the sound from the unsound, and pit the unsound. To preserve these in their present state for future use and next year's seed, is a great object. It is recommended to put layers of compost of lime and dry earth: I would try this with some; with other pits I would try layers of salt. We know, in other matters, such as meat and hay, it is an antiseptic; and that cabbage is preserved in Germany by placing layers of rock salt between each layer of cut cabbage, which otherwise would decompose and rot in a short time. In other pits I would recommend layers of charcoal: this will, I know, prevent decay. I have sent game, in which bits of charcoal were put, a long distance, and they arrived quite sound. Pieces of charcoal were put into a cellar or bran, which was getting unsound, and it has been brought into a state of perfect sweetness by them. Peat mould is an antiseptic; and bodies of animals have been found in bogs undecomposed. Perhaps by filling the interstices between the potatoes in the pits with peat mould—from the turf heap—future decomposition might be prevented, Agriculturists are now like the physicians, when first (and I may say last) the cholera visited the land, certain of no remedy, but desirous to try every one likely to succeed. Professor Kane's opinion would be of great value; but every remedy","['Germany', None, 'Germany, Ireland']",Deutschland,country,51.1638175,10.4478313,"['47.2701114', '55.0991610', '5.8663153', '15.0419309']"

"Sir- I beg to acquaint you that all this part of the country is in a most dreadful state with the disease in the potato crop. It is really alarming; and if some means be not discovered, whereby to stop its progress, the destruction of this important crop, to a very serious extent, is inevitable. I commenced first to dig pinkeye potatoes for the Dublin market, on the second of this month, at which time I found a great many quite rotten. I picked about a barrel of them ; and having cut them into thin slices, laid them down on a barn floor, and strewed about a quarter of a stone of salt among them, making sure both sides of the sliced potatoes were equally salted. Two days after this had been done I went into the barn to look at them, but the smell was so offensive, that I could scarcely bear it. The salt had become dissolved, and was running all over the floor. The potatoes were allowed to remain in this state for two days longer, and on being examined then the smell was found entirely to have left them. I took them out, laid them in a small pit, and carefully covered the whole with straw and earth. On Saturday last I ex- amined them again, and found them quite safe: a little slaked June was then put amongst them; but, probably, they might have done without it. I have two or three hundred barrels of apple potatoes, the most of which are more or less affected. They have all been raised within the last fifteen days, and laid on dry straw in pits, at the rate of about two barrels to the yard, on a ridge having a fall to each side. The potatoes were mixed with alternate layers of straw, «wheat-chaff, and lime mixed j and I can safely assert, that since they","['Dublin', None, 'Dublin, Ireland']","Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, Éire / Ireland",city,53.3493795,-6.2605593,"['53.2987342', '53.4105416', '-6.3870259', '-6.1148829']"

"_ With respect to the animal kingdom, have vre not heard it a& an undisputed fact, that lions, tigers,leopards, monkeys, and other wild animals, which are brought here from foreign parts, generally contract disease after a short residence ? A few years ago it used to be the custom, among captains of vessels trading to the West Indies, to take a score or two of dogs with them, as a small speculation, on their own account. So many of the dogs died from the effects of .the climate, that the trade is now abandoned; and the planters are at present obliged to breed these animals for the use of their estates. Human beings also, asis familiar to every one, are not exempt from the deleterious influence of change of climate. How many young men who have emigrated to the Indies, or America, have been attacked with disease there, and died—diseases too, which the natives of the place are not liable to take!

"Q  procreate. Birds refuse to breed when confined in cages. The imprisoned eagle will not pair. Plants, likewise, lose their regenerative power, in many cases, by removal from their natural soil, or by the induction of artificial habits. It is a most singular fact, that the sugar cane, though cultivated in every country in the tropics, either in the old or new world, will form seed only in the East Indies, its native place.

"The fact that the disease of this crop began with the putrefaction of its seed, seems to point out a method or avoiding this next spring: if we prepare a portion of good, but not too rich soil, early in spring, dibble smallish uncut tubers 4 to 5 indies deep, and about the same distance asunder every way, in this soil; prepare the potato drills as usual in April or May; when the young plants come a few inches above ground raise them carefully, remove the seed without injuring the roots, and plant in the drills either by dibbling in or slightly splitting up the drills, laying the p;ants 8 or 10 inches apart and covering them.

"SIR — Being much interested about the melancholy state of the potato crop, I think every person ought seriously consider what mode to adopt to insure, if possible, a crop for next year, I therefore wish for your opinion upon the trial I am inclined to make immediately, as now I can select sound seed; and it is impossible to say if that will be the case next March. I have ready the spot of ground (one and a-half acres) on which my late crop of potatoes grew, and finer could not be seen, but, I am sorry to say, they are gradually decaying, though every care is taken to give them as much air as possible. What I think of doing is, to harrow in about 60 or 70 barrels of lime, or 5 cwt. of guano; open the drills; plant whole potatoes, 12 inches apart; ridge them up well and high, to preserve them against frost and rain, and let them remain so until the end of March; then examine them, and if found growing well all will be right; if on the contrary, they fail. A crop of barley can be sown and in the meantime, I can have another spot of ground ready for the potatoes, provided sound seed can be had. I have twice planted potatoes in November, and found it answer well - no failure in them. Some may say it may be wrong to plant them in the ground from whence they have just been taken, as it may be infected. I say that is folly; as in that case every potato field in the united kingdom must have been so,","['the united kingdom', None, 'the united kingdom, Ireland']","The (Oval) Banqueting Suite, 372, Stratford Road, Sparkhill, Sparkbrook, Birmingham, West Midlands Combined Authority, England, B11 4AB, United Kingdom",building,52.45777545,-1.869209938214711,"['52.4576816', '52.4580336', '-1.8696421', '-1.8688657']"

It has been shown by Mr. Grey, of Dilston, that, in Northumberland, his potato crop has been considerably increased in quantity by this practice, and that he has no disease in it this year. In 1844, his autumn-planted crop, produced 100 and 111 loads, when the same quantity of spring planted land yielded but 80 loads under the same circumstances.

The effect to be anticipated from autumn planting consists not merely in a probable increase of quantity in next year's supply, but in the saving of potatoes which may perish before spring, if the slow growth which goes on during winter is arrested, and in the early ripening of next year's crop in the event of a second unfavourable season supervening.

Neither do we learn that the early period at which the leaves appear above the ground, in spring, is attended with any greater risk than what attends precarious crops like the potato in any season. The effect to be anticipated from autumn planting consists not merely in a probable increase of quantity in next year's supply, but in the saving of potatoes which may perish before spring, if the slow growth which goes on during winter is arrested, and in the early ripening of next year's crop in the event of a second unfavourable season supervening.

"One other subject I am tempted to draw your attention to, from its connection with the natural progress of rural industry in this and similar districts of the country. You know that in the neighbourhood of large towns, the raising of potatoes is a very profitable branch of farming and that this arises in part from the circumstance that the great weight of this crop excludes the distant producer of it from entering into successful competition with the suburban farmers. Hence, where good potato lands occur, and good crops are, or can be, easily raised, at a distance from markets, the tenant is prevented, by the cost of transport, from availing himself, in the greatest degree, of the peculiar qualities of his soil. It is therefore of consequence in such localities to discover a mode of manufacturing the potato into some other commodity of easier transport, and, if possible, of as ready a sale. In the north of Europe, it is a very common thing to attach a distillery to a large farm, for the purpose of working up the potato crop, by converting it into brandy. In our country the farmer cannot adopt this method, but he can convert his potatoes into farina or potato flour. Into this manufacture great improvements have recently been introduced; and the farina is converted into British tapioca, into syrup, and other articles, which find a more or less ready market. The waste fibre of the potato, which formerly was considered fit only for manure, is now converted into a wholesome nourishment for cattle; and even the washings of the starch, where skill and economy preside over the process, are collected and employed as a manure. You recollect the fact mentioned to us as your brother- in-law, Mr. Binning Home, that these washings, when allowed to run into the potato drills, had given, near Stirling, a larger crop of potatoes than was yielded by other parts of the same field, to which guano and farm-yard manure had been","['Europe', None, 'Europe, Ireland']",Europe,continent,51.0,10.0,"['26.0000000', '76.0000000', '-15.0000000', '35.0000000']"

You recollect the fact mentioned to us as your brother- in-law, Mr. Binning Home, that these washings, when allowed to run into the potato drills, had given, near Stirling, a larger crop of potatoes than was yielded by other parts of the same field, to which guano and farm-yard manure had been","['Stirling', None, 'Stirling, Ireland']","Stirling, Stirlingshire, Alba / Scotland, FK8 2DD, United Kingdom",city,56.1181242,-3.9360012,"['55.9581242', '56.2781242', '-4.0960012', '-3.7760012']"

"In Germany, a method has lately been introduced of making flour from potatoes, which has: not, I believe been tried in this country, but which is recommended as giving a better, a more palatable, and a more abundant article of nourishment than the common process of preparing potato-starch. This method consists in washing the potatoes, cutting them into slices, as we do turnips, steeping these slices for twenty- four hours in water containing one per cent, of sulphuric acid, (oil of vitriol), drawing off the acid water, washing them several times with pure water, drying them in a stove, and then grinding them in a common corn-mill. The flour thus obtained is pure white, and the refuse sittings or bran seldom exceed five per cent, of the weight of the dried potatoes. The sulphuric acid in this process extracts the colouring matter of the potato, with certain other substances which would give the flour an unpleasant taste. This flour will not make good bread if used alone—it requires to be mixed with from one to one-third of wheaten flour.","['Germany', None, 'Germany, Ireland']",Deutschland,country,51.1638175,10.4478313,"['47.2701114', '55.0991610', '5.8663153', '15.0419309']"

The starch dissolves, and the liquid becomes sweet from its conversion into grape-sugar. This is the method which M. Boggild of Copenhagen proposes to apply to the whole potato, in order to bring it into a soluble state, to make it more easy of digestion, and thus to increase its feeding properties. :","['Copenhagen', None, 'Copenhagen, Ireland']","København, Københavns Kommune, Indre By, Region Hovedstaden, 1357, Danmark",city,55.6867243,12.5700724,"['55.5267243', '55.8467243', '12.4100724', '12.7300724']"

"The potato crop, during the month of July and beginning of August, this year, looked particularly well. There was a luxuriousness of the leaves, flowers, and stalks, which led most people to suppose that there would be an unusual yield, and that the crop would be more than an average one. During the last fortnight of the month of August the weather became very warm—during several days the heat was excessive, and the days were succeeded by cold nights. The air at the time was apparently in a highly electric state; and the country people on the sea coast say that lightning was observed over a wide extent of the horizon, which appeared to come from the direction of the sea, or the east coast, and cross the country towards the west. The first signs of the disease were observed during the last fortnight of the month of August, immediately after the sultry days mentioned. The leaves of the potato plant were found to be dotted with a number brownish- black spots of variable size, or the edge point of one or more of the leaflets became brown, curled up, dried, and withered. This extended to the others, until the whole leaf was shriveled. It commenced upon the uppermost leaflets, was always most marked in them, and extended downwards: sometimes the uppermost leaves were withered, while those lower down were still green. The stalk of the plant was not discoloured until all the leaves had dried up. It did not extend in the same proportion over the whole field, in some ridges the leaves were discoloured and shriveled while those in neighbouring ridges were still green. Eventually the leaves entirely withered, the stalks became white and dry, and the fields presented the appearance in the middle of September (or about a month from the time it was first noticed) that they ordinarily do in the middle of November.","['the east coast', None, 'the east coast, Ireland']","The Coast at Lakeshore East, 345, East Wacker Drive, Lakeshore East, Loop, Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, 60601, United States",building,41.88721135,-87.61861075132671,"['41.8869712', '41.8874713', '-87.6188986', '-87.6183566']"
"o)  This decay in the leaves made its appearance in the majority of cases before the fruit had been fully formed. in places where it had arrived at maturity, it was not spotted or marked like the leaves, but preserved its colour after the stalk had withered. The appearance presented by the tuber varied according to the stage of the disease. In the early stage the tubers presented upon their surface patches of a livid colour, and of larger or smaller size at those points, the cuticle readily separated. On cutting into them, the centre was sound; but underneath the livid blotches, to the depth of a line, the surface had a yellowish brown colour; they gave out an unpleasant smell at this stage. When the disease was more advanced, the greater part of the surface of the tuber had a dirty, livid colour; when taken in the hand it felt less firm than natural upon one side, or over whole surface; when cut into it was found to be softened at one side, and this part had a dull, dirty, yellow colour and a watery liquid escaped which yielded an unpleasant smell. These observations were made between the 16th and 22nd of September, at which time the leaves and stalks in the majority of the potato fields were’ completely withered, and the peculiar disagreeable odour given out, was perceptible at a distance, and even passing along the roads. The diseased appearance in the tubers did not, however, keep pace with, or bear proportion to, the decay of the leaves; for in many places where the stalks were entirely gone, the potatoes were perfectly sound; while, in others, many tubers in an early, and some in an advanced stage, were found, although the leaves were but partially withered, and this in different parts of the same field. Where the potatoes had been planted late, many of the tubers dug at this time were below the average size, and some of them so small as not to be worth digging. The variety of the potato in which, at this time, I found the disease most strongly marked, was that called the peeler. In one locality I found, in a few instances, every tuber upon the set to be more or less diseased; in others, one or two upon a set were in an advanced state of decay, and the rest not larger than marbles. The next was the Scotch-grey—a_ kind introduced into the country about thirteen or fourteen years ago: next came the Scotch-whites, and the lumper potato; a white, sound, early potato, called the white rounds, and a long, black potato, called long blacks, were almost perfectly round, although the stalk and leaves had completely withered like the rest. The cup and apple potato, at this time, were supposed to have escaped. During the month of September the weather continued fine and dry, and the disease appeared to make little progress. Very wet weather, however, set in at the beginning of October; a week subsequent to which a material change for the worse was observed; and I found every fifth or sixth potato affected in a field where, previously, not above one in twenty was diseased. The cup and apple potato, which had been comparatively sound, were now engaged, but not to the same extent as the others—every set of which, in some parts of the field, had one tuber with the livid patches already described. In a few cases all the tubers in the same set were diseased, and one of them was then always softened either in part, or through its entire substance, and gave out the peculiar characteristic odour. The potatoes planted in drills were as much affected as those in ridges; and those in sandy soil as much as in heavy clay lands; and in thorough-drained ground as much as in ground which had not been drained.

"in the spring of 1844, I planted a field of about three acres with potatoes of various descriptions. The field was situated upon the slope of a mountain about three miles from Montreal; the soil was alluvial upon limestone rock. It had been hand-dug throughout, the previous autumn, for the purpose of removing roots, granite boulders, &c., and in order to level the ground, which was virgin soil, never previously having been turned up. I manured the entire field with old stable manure, chiefly with the view of stimulating the growth of the young apple, pear, and cherry-trees, which were planted in it. One quarter of an acre consisted of new varieties recently raised from seed; and I seldom have seen a crop that gave greater promise: some of the leaves were unusually large, with thick vigorous stalks. During the months of July and August we had repeated and heavy showers, with oppressive heat, and an atmosphere strongly charged with electricity. Towards the close of the month of August I observed the leaves to be marked with black spots, as if ink had been sprinkled over them; they began to wither, emitting a peculiar offensive odour, and before a fortnight, the field, which had been singularly luxuriant and almost rank, became arid and dried up, as if after a severe frost. I had the potatoes dug out during the month of September, when about two-thirds were either positively rotten, partially decayed and swarming with worms, or spotted with brownish-coloured patches, resembling flesh that had been frost-bitten. These parts were soft to the touch; and upon the decayed potatoes I observed a whitish substance like mould. The smell from the diseased potatoes was so offensive that some farmers would not even plough them up. The disease extended over several hundred miles of country, including Lower and Upper Canada, and the Northern States. The disease was not universal: some farmers in the low-lands, near my residence, escaped, while their neighbours suffered so much that (as I have observed) they would not plough up the crop, satisfied that it would not pay the outlay, and fearing for their health. Several instances occurred where pigs, having fed upon the diseased potatoes unboiled, died. One diseased potato infected a heap of many tons, and much of the crop was lost in this way. Many persons attributed the calamity to electricity; it was previously unknown in the couniry, and occurred during a period of great heat. It has occurred again in Canada this year: so at least the newspapers state.

"in the spring of 1844, I planted a field of about three acres with potatoes of various descriptions. The field was situated upon the slope of a mountain about three miles from Montreal; the soil was alluvial upon limestone rock. It had been hand-dug throughout, the previous autumn, for the purpose of removing roots, granite boulders, &c., and in order to level the ground, which was virgin soil, never previously having been turned up. I manured the entire field with old stable manure, chiefly with the view of stimulating the growth of the young apple, pear, and cherry-trees, which were planted in it. One quarter of an acre consisted of new varieties recently raised from seed; and I seldom have seen a crop that gave greater promise: some of the leaves were unusually large, with thick vigorous stalks. During the months of July and August we had repeated and heavy showers, with oppressive heat, and an atmosphere strongly charged with electricity. Towards the close of the month of August I observed the leaves to be marked with black spots, as if ink had been sprinkled over them; they began to wither, emitting a peculiar offensive odour, and before a fortnight, the field, which had been singularly luxuriant and almost rank, became arid and dried up, as if after a severe frost. I had the potatoes dug out during the month of September, when about two-thirds were either positively rotten, partially decayed and swarming with worms, or spotted with brownish-coloured patches, resembling flesh that had been frost-bitten. These parts were soft to the touch; and upon the decayed potatoes I observed a whitish substance like mould. The smell from the diseased potatoes was so offensive that some farmers would not even plough them up. The disease extended over several hundred miles of country, including Lower and Upper Canada, and the Northern States. The disease was not universal: some farmers in the low-lands, near my residence, escaped, while their neighbours suffered so much that (as I have observed) they would not plough up the crop, satisfied that it would not pay the outlay, and fearing for their health.

"The chemist is, perhaps the most helpless of the three. He has already analysed sound and diseased potatoes with the most scrupulous accuracy; yet his results indicate nothing in point. I might as soon, on disease appearing suddenly in a flock, take a sound and a diseased sheep, burn the body of each, and analyse their ashes, to discover from this the nature of the disease, and learn how to cure the rest. Chemistry is of great value in its own province; but it cannot do everything. The entomologist may look at the insects which prey on the dead matter, and give us hard terms enough to describe their classification; but he cannot blame them as the cause of the disease. He might as well blame the insects and venues in a churchyard for the death of those interred in it. And the mycologist may describe the mould or fungi which appear on the stem and tubers; but the only fact he can infer from their presence is, that the decaying potato affords suitable food for them. He may answer some questions to which I referred in a former article, and their answer may be of use to guide our hopes and conduct next season; but his labours in this are no more than will be gratuitously performed by many. When the talents of the most competent persons in Europe are anxiously and gratuitously engaged on the same subject, why should disrespect be shown to their labours by hiring a favoured few not more competent than many others.

"The researches I have undertaken upon the sound and diseased potatoes of the present year have disclosed to me the remarkable fact that they contain, in the sap, a considerable quantity of vegetable casein (cheese), perceptible by acids. This constituent I did not observe in my previous researches. It would thus appear that, from the influence of the weather, or, generally speaking, from atmospheric causes, a part of the albumen which prevails in the potato has been converted into vegetable casein. The great instability of the last substance is well known— hence the facility with which the potato containing it undergoes putrefaction. Any injury to health from the use of these potatoes is out of the question; and nowhere in Germany has such an effect’ been observed. In the diseased potato no solanin can be discovered. It may be of some use to call attention to the fact that diseased potatoes may easily, and at little expense, be preserved for a length of time, and afterwards, employed in various ways, by cutting them into slices of about a quarter of an inch thick, and immersing them in water, containing from two to three per cent. of sulphuric acid. After twenty-four or thirty-six hours the acid liquor may be drawn off, and all remains of it washed away by steeping in successive, portions of fresh water. Treated in this manner, the potatoes are easily dried. The pieces are white, and of little weight, can be ground into flour, and baked into bread along with the flour of wheat.","['Germany', None, 'Germany, Ireland']",Deutschland,country,51.1638175,10.4478313,"['47.2701114', '55.0991610', '5.8663153', '15.0419309']"

It is obvious that the proportion of azotized matter which can be beneficially employed by the cultivator, must depend on the dryness of the soil and the amount of sunshine enjoyed.

"A quarter of a century ago, the country suffered under a deficiency of food, from which resulted famine and consequent disease.

"However, even if it were desirable to look forward to private charity, as a means of alleviating whatever distress may be produced by the diminution in the quantity of the ordinary food of the Irish people, there are circumstances which render it very unlikely, that on the present occasion, such charity can be expected. Other countries have suffered, at least as much, if not more than Ireland, and in each country the relief of its own poor must be the primary object. We must, therefore, meet whatever difficulty may exist by our own energies, each in his proper sphere; there is need for the exertion of all. The labouring and poorer classes must work to purchase food. The higher classes must exert: themselves to provide employment for the poor.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"It is peculiarly fortunate at the present time, that the great mass of railway and other commercial enterprise, of which our country promises to be the field, should afford the means of occupying such considerable numbers. It is also to be hoped that an additional impulse shall be given by the necessity of the present period, to those operations of public works, by which the government can so efficiently extend the field of employment; at the same time that it establishes the most permanent and trustworthy basis of social order, the improvement of the country, and of the people. But the council of the Royal Agricultural Society feel that with a population so vast as the labouring class of Ireland, these two great sources of employment may not afford full means of support during the coming year, formally of those whose ordinary supply of food may be deficient, and who must look elsewhere for ‘subsistence. It is on this account that the council thus venture to appeal to the landed proprietors, members of the society, and others, for their intervention, to assist the people through this difficulty; not for charity or gift; not even for loans, or patronage, but for the exercise of that intelligence, and prudent foresight, that enterprise and skill, which they and those who act for them in business, so generally possess, and which can be employed at present in a manner so","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"It is ascertained by the concurrent testimony and experience of the most enlightened agriculturists, that there is in this country and climate, no obstacle so powerful to the development of the true agricultural riches of the soil, as the wetness with which the land, even in favoured districts, is constantly infiltrated. It would be here unnecessary, and indeed in addressing an agricultural body, so enlightened as the landed proprietors of Ireland, quite superfluous to describe the several ways in which moisture deteriorates the quality of the soil, abstracts its heat, and impoverishes the produce. They are facts fully established as parts of our authentic agricultural experience, and the remedy is also known. It is drainage; the removing the surplus moisture, and admitting the various agencies which mature the process of vegetation, to come into full play, and suitably reward the industry of the prudent farmer.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"Drainage is fundamental and anterior to all other agricultural improvements. You may apply the richest and most suitable manures, yet if your farm is wet and cold they are of no profit; but if the farm be brought into proper condition by judicious drainage, then are not merely artificial manures capable of yielding full returns but the natural powers of the soil are brought to life, and luxuriant crops reward the labour upon land previously branded as barren. There is uot an estate in Ireland, scarcely a farm, in which this change is not still to be effected. In every district may be seen tracts upon which labour could be thus expended with advantage, and in ail those districts are to be found masses of people who may be in want of food, or of wages to purchase food, to whom the improvement of the soil should be the natural and most important object.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"The question of drainage improvement, however, deserves the attention of the landed proprietors, and is recommended to them by the council at the present juncture; not merely upon the grounds of beneficence and kindly intervention, but there are pecuniary advantages connected with the occupation of the people in that way, which it is of great importance that the landed proprietors of Ireland should fully appreciate.

"There is no investment now known, so absolutely profitable as the improvement of land by drainage. A manufacturer realizing 15 or 20 per cent. On the capital he embarks in trade, is considered most successful and a 100 competitors rush into the same line, and cut down his profits to the ordinary level of trade. But it is perfectly established by experience that, in every kind of circumstances, that the expense of thorough draining land is repaid by the increased produce frequently in four years and sometimes in three, under judicious management. Thus the profit becomes 25 or per cent. until the capital has been repaid. But the good is not then exhausted; the benefit to the land continues. It is certain, that to the labourer, to whom it gives employment, to the farmer to whom it gives greater produce, and more Certain returns to the capitalist and proprietor, to whom it affords the most suitable and profitable investment, and to the state, to which it gives an improved soil, and an industrious population, there is no field for enterprise so important as the drainage of the land in the present circumstances of Ireland.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"DEC. 9th—The first annual lecture was delivered this evening in the theatre of the Royal Institution, by Dr. Lyon Playfair. The subject was the present distemper in the potato. The lecturer commenced by making some general remarks on the history of the potato, and its cultivation in this and the other countries of Europe. he also exhibited diagrams of the structure of the potato, and tables of the chemical composition of the tuber in its healthy state. He then described the nature of the changes, which took place in the potato under the influence of the disease. Much had been said and written with regard to the source of the disease, and since minute fungi were frequently found present in the decayed potato, the disease had been attributed to them as a cause. Some potatoes, apples, and other things had been inoculated with the sporules of the fungus, and these had become diseased. But if there were not some previous disease in the potato, how was it that some potatoes escaped whilst others were attacked ? The disease, he believed, arose from physical or chemical causes. It was simply a decay of the tissue of the potato, arising from the union of the tissues of the potato with the oxygen of the atmosphere. When a decayed potato was examined, it was found that the diseased spots were always found in the region of the tissue called spiral vessels, whose function it was to carry air into the tissue of the potato.","['Europe', None, 'Europe, Ireland']",Europe,continent,51.0,10.0,"['26.0000000', '76.0000000', '-15.0000000', '35.0000000']"
"196  The reason why the cells entered into this decomposition so rapidly arose from a constitutional weakness on the part of the cells of the tuber. This decay is rapidly - spread from one cell to another, and the looser the tissue the more rapid the decay. By grating the tissue of some sound potatoes, and exposing it to the atmosphere of the lecture-room, it speedily assumed the colour of the diseased potato. The cause of the constitutonal weakness in the cells of the tuber was undoubtedly to be looked for in the weather. A peculiar weather had been observed over the whole of the north of Europe, when the disease had been - observed, as well as in America. The disease was no new thing, and appeared always when such weather occurred. At the time the plant commenced growing there was very warm and mild weather; and this was ‘followed by cold and wet weather. The consequence was, the cellular tissue of the tuber contained more water than usual. In previous years an analyses of the potato gave on an average 72 per cent, of water, but analyses which he had made, this year, of healthy potatoes, gave from 72 to 75 per cent, of water, whilst the analyses of diseased potatoes gave as much as 80 per cent, of water. Other plants contained the same increase of water constituents, as turnips, and turnips were also affected with the same disease. Turnips were not affected so generally as potatoes, on account of their nitrogenous principles not being soluble as those of the potato were. The disease then was a ""consumption"" of the potato, arising from the decay of its particles in combination with the oxygen of the atmosphere, produced by the state of the cellular tissue, brought on by the weather. It arises from no degeneracy in the potato, and it need only to be feared from a repetition of the same circumstances. In the storing and preserving the potato one great fact should be borne in mind, and that is, that the decaying particles were capable of communicating the decay to the sound tissue. Care then should be taken that they be freely ventilated, that they are kept dry and cool, and there be absence of contact of the potatoes. He defended the directions given by the Irish commissioners for the storing and preserving the potatoes as those best adapted for obtaining the object in view in the community to which those directions were addressed. At the conclusion of the lecture, a vote of thanks to the lecturer was proposed by the Duke of Richmond, and seconded by P.

Gerard, in his Herbal, published in 1597, gives a figure of the Solarium tuberosum, under the name of ""Potato of Virginia"". In Johnson's edition of Gerard, dated 1633, we find a description of two species of potato: the Peruvian or Spanish, without flowers, probably the Battata—and the potato of Virginia, the roots of which, he tells us, he received from Virginia, otherwise called","['Virginia', None, 'Virginia, Ireland']","Virginia, United States",state,37.1232245,-78.4927721,"['36.5407896', '39.4660120', '-83.6753671', '-75.1664350']"

"9. About 20 years ago, two French chemists (Messrs Gautier de Chaubry andCollin) ‘made known a very sin.jular and important property of starch—that it assumes a blue colour on being mixed with iodine. This test is so very delicate, that when starch is boiled in one thousand times its weight of water, the addition of iodine will produce a blue colour; so that iodine affords the best means of detecting starch, and starch again of detecting iodine. The iodine test, in this way, has contributed largely to the advance of chemical science; it has thrown light upon some very difficult questions of vegetable physiology, and has assisted in detecting, and therefore preventing, fraudulent sophistication. This test affords the best means of ascertaining the presence and quantity of iodine in salt water, sulphur in a mineral water, of ammonia in certain solutions of impurities and hardness in springs and wells.

"SIR—At this dead time of the year it is not improbable but the torpor which affects animals and plants is communicated to the mind through the animal portion of our present formation.

"I am of opinion that a gradual deterioration has taken place either in climate, land, or in the nature of the plant itself, of late years. Some forty or fifty years ago we had no such potato as the Lumper or horse potato (only fit for pigs or cattle); the red apple potato for winter, the kidney for early, and the white-eye for harvest, were then the kinds grown in this country by rich and poor. The crops were most abundant, and the quality very fine. The red apple can only be","['Lumper', None, 'Lumper, Ireland']","Lumper, Lumperhof, Albertshofen, Ravensburg, Verwaltungsverband Mittleres Schussental, Landkreis Ravensburg, Baden-Württemberg, 88212, Deutschland",road,47.7732325,9.6316117,"['47.7725882', '47.7747514', '9.6293169', '9.6325533']"
"The mode of planting potatoes in drill would interfere with this plan, but they might be planted in land of similar quality, by ploughing lea-land with a double furrow, or trench-ploughing, the first sod being very light; this being done very early, and in spring, a second trench-ploughing and good harrowing might be given. We have had many meetings in different localities-many opinions given—a great deal -written on the subject-government employers—professors to make reports and give instructions; but though done with the best intentions, ! believe it has all been like a failing merchant flying kites through the bank to keep the evil day as distant as possible, or like washing the Blackamoor white—labour thrown away, or ""Nero fiddling while Rome was on fire."" In a case of so much vital importance as the sustenance of 9,000,000 of people, all of whom are deeply, personally interested, and 4,000,000 of whom depend altogether on this crop for existence, now, that its uncertainty has been too often proved, something else must be done to enable the people to have some other provision to look to, and to put them on a par with the inhabitants of other countries who are not dependent on it. I will endeavour to point out what would tend to this most desirable object; and if carried out to the full, would effectually accomplish it; and if I can prove this, which I trust being able to do, we may look, without fear or alarm, to an increase of population for future years, propor-tionable to what has resulted in the past, where, within the memory of the lately-deceased Lord Carbery, the population increased from 3,000,000, which was, in his youth, the sum of the population when he stated we were then an importing country, to the present time, when we are 9,000,000, and exporting provisions of all kinds to a very great extent. _ I will confine myself to two principle subjects, -which will be "" the burthen of my song"" in my next letter—Yours, &c.,","['Rome', None, 'Rome, Ireland']","Roma, Roma Capitale, Lazio, Italia",city,41.8933203,12.4829321,"['41.6556417', '42.1410285', '12.2344669', '12.8557603']"

"18. Starch is obtained from the potato, as already stated (6), by a very simple process. The tubers are first washed, then rasped; the rasped pulp is strained, the starch is allowed to subside, and washed again; iti s then cautiously dried, and is ready for sale or domestic use. The operations of washing and rasping are best performed by simple machinery. I am obliged to Mr. Roper for the plan of a starch machine, taken from M. Payen. It explains itself sufficiently. English ingenuity will not fail to perfect machines of this kind to be used on a large or small scale, whenever the various applications of starch shall become generally known and practicable. Starch thus obtained may be preserved for any length of time. It undergoes no change from exposure to the air in any climate. The extraction of starch from the potato is little attended to in this country. The quantity manufactured in France, was, in 1840, about 12,000,000 kilogrammes or 12,000 tons. The tubers which ripen soonest are the best for this manufacture. Preference is given to those which on trial are found to contain least water. They are the most productive and keep the longest. It is a great recommendation to this branch of industry, that it furnishes employment to the agriculturists at the dead season of _ the year.

"DEAR SIRI am in receipt, of your letter of the 22nd: inst., and am glad to say that the potatoes are not getting worse. During the last month the disease has got a check, and they are now selling in Ballina for one shilling per cwt., of 8 stone (lumpers); other kinds from one shilling to one and sixpence per cut.","['Ballina', None, 'Ballina, Ireland']","Ballina, Ballina Municipal District, County Mayo, Connacht, Éire / Ireland",town,54.1143359,-9.1532099,"['54.0949381', '54.1352617', '-9.1737626', '-9.1252567']"
"siIR—In reply to your correspondent, Mr. Daly, of Chantilly, as he has spoken freely on my letter, I beg leave to take the same liberty with his. In the first place, he says, a part of my letter smells too much of the forcing department of gardening; I would beg of Mr. Daly to take into consideration the case under which I wrote, namely, the increasing the number of sets, supposing there would be a difficulty in getting enough in the spring; and secondly, the forwarding an early crop, supposing there would be a scarcity of food in the early part of the next summer. Now, I beg of Mr. D. to notice all I say on these subjects. In the first place, I say it is fortunate that the small or middle sized potatoes are in general free from disease, and that these, if taken care of, will make very-good seed for one year; but that, as they might he considered in the light of abortive tubers, the produce of them should never be planted a second year. (The last sentence was omitted in the Gazette, although in the MS.) I still maintain that if you plant small potatoes, the produce of smal! ones, they will continue to degenerate from year to year, until the crop becomes worthless. In the second place, I recommended that a set or two should be taken from the rose end of all potatoes before they were boiled; and that, lastly, if a efficiency of sets was still apprehended, recourse was to be had to the only remaining source, namely, to excite the tubers on a gentle hotbed.","['Gazette', None, 'Gazette, Ireland']","Gazette, Shire of Southern Grampians, Victoria, 3289, Australia",city_district,-37.9179185,142.15816215649903,"['-37.9623130', '-37.8733780', '142.0744360', '142.2168520']"

"O  the nature of the general or epidemic influence in the potato murrain, nothing very definite can yet be stated. We know nothing, indeed, of the general influences affecting the epidemics in man and the domestic animals except the existence of such epidemic influences, find, to a certain extent, the laws of their approach, progress, and retrocession. The local or individual causes of attack in the plants themselves here, as in the other epidemics, promise to yield more easily to inquiry, and to afford more legitimate indications for prevention. In various epidemics, Mr. Goodsir stated, that these two causes have different degrees of influence; and it was interesting to know, that in proportion to our knowledge of the nature of the secondary or local causes, was the power we possessed of arresting the progress of an epidemic. The plague, for instance, the secondary cause of which, filthy habits, &e., were well known, is arrested in direct proportion to the improvement in the habits of the people; for the plague is an epidemic disease in which the general epidemic influence is not so powerful as the secondary causes. In Cholera, again, the epidemic influence is stronger than the secondary causes, so that its progress cannot be arrested in the same degree. The general influence appears to be more powerful in the potato murrain than any secondary cause. The plants affected do not appear to be inferior to those of former seasons in quality; at least, they certainly contain as much starch, and as compact a texture, as they usually do. If such be the general nature of the influences bearing on the disease, a remedy or mode of arrest was not to be hoped for to the extent some might expect. Here, as in most diseases In man and the domestic animals, our knowledge of the nature of the disease much exceeded our means of cure or prevention. After alluding to the opinion which appeared to be gaining ground, that contagious and epidemic diseases depend not on an altered condition of the infected individuals per se, but on an influence exerted on them by parasitic or organic beings, developed in or on them—an opinion supported not only by the detection of such parasites in certain diseases, but, also, by the general phenomena of progress, attack, and arrest. Mr. Goodsir elated that he had always, as others had done, detected in the diseased potato at least two kinds of parasitic fungi— One a minute granular, spherical, deep brown body, which existed in enormous numbers from the very first access of the disease—the other a branching filiform tubular fungus, with terminal sporidia, containing spores, and appearing in the potato rather later apparently than the brown spherical parasite. They both exist in the cavities of the polygonal culls of the tuber, the brown fungus adhering to the wall of the cells, and the outside of the coats of the starch cells, binding them together; the filiform parasite branching among and between the starch cells, SO as to be obscured by them. As these fungi are universally present in the diseased potato, we cannot, in considering the nature and cause of the disease, keep their existence out of view. There can no longer be any doubt that the chemical influence produced by the contents of the cells of certain parts of plants produce certain chemical actions in the juices of those, plants, and also that a similar influence was in all probability exerted on certain fluids in which minute fungi exist, such as the yeast plant in yeast, &c.; it is, therefore, a legitimate hypothesis that constant fungi in the diseased potato must direct or influence the chemical actions and effects which have been detected in the diseased tubers. This view of the subject in no way is to overthrow the chemical explanations of the potato blight, but confirms the chemico-vital view of the subject, by combining the opinions of those who apparently differ concerning the disease. In this, as in other","['Cholera', None, 'Cholera, Ireland']","Cholera Monument Grounds, Sheaf Valley, Park Hill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom",park,53.376246699999996,-1.457929686646755,"['53.3755428', '53.3769694', '-1.4599048', '-1.4568172']"
"Mr. Goodsir, in further illustration of the subject, adverted to the existence of vegetable fungus in the minnow, gold fish, frogs, and neuts; and as the employment of moss water, as a means of checking the disease, had been recommended by the commissioners in Ireland, it may have the effect of killing the fungi in the potato tuber, in the same manner as creosote is known to destroy vegetable fungus in the human stomach.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"Mr. Lawson then read the substance of a communication from Sir James Miles Biddell of Strontain, and another from his overseer, Mr, Thomas Smith, on a col- lection of potatoes presented to the society's museum, which had been raised from seed collected in October, 1842.

In spring, 1844, they were planted whole, and the collection now exhibited on the table was the produce. The transplanting in July seems a good practice. Sir James states that the produce was quite healthy on 3rd December, when he wrote, and that previous to that period only a very few had been discovered that showed any symptoms of disease, which was the case throughout generally in his neighbourhood. Sir James's opinion is, that the primary cause of the disease is the extreme humidity of the summer and autumn, and this opinion is, to some extent, corroborated by a communication which Mr. Lawson had received from an extensive proprietor in Holland, Mr. M. E. Havelaar, of Rotterdam, of date, the 28th November, who says, that everywhere in strong moist soils the crop had failed, while in dry soils it had produced an average crop; that the potatoes taken up during rain- became diseased, whilst those which were lifted dry did not become so. Throughout Holland generally, in marshy soils, he adds, the disease showed itself in July, in Guelderland in August. Sir James Riddell draws these conclusions—1. That there is no deterioration of the plant—2. That he has no reason to suppose that a fungus is the primary cause—3. That the variable temperature and excessive moisture of the season were sufficient to produce it and 4. That the separation of the diseased potatoes, and drying the good ones, are the only processes necessary to preserve them.","['Holland', None, 'Holland, Ireland']",Nederland,country,52.2434979,5.6343227,"['11.8250000', '53.7443950', '-68.6255319', '7.2274985']"

Its cultivation here, also, was limited to the garden for a century and a-half.

In drills, most of the work can be done by women and children, which, in beds, require men; the ground is more improved; the frequent stirring, hoeing, and moulding the much greater surface exposed to the atmospheric influences, ameliorate and improve the soil, reduce clayey soils to a friable mould, and render it free for the admission of the minute fibres to extract the fertilizing gases to invigorate the crop. In Scotland, that country of agricultural perfection, based on science and practice, a field in bed potatoes is not to be found.

"Surely Mr. Townsend is hardly serious when he says, that in drills the dung “is at once drawn out, and immediately covered,"" whereby the ammonia is preserved; but that, ""in beds this cannot be done,"" and the dung is often left exposed for days, the ammonia evanescing. For upwards of forty years I have been putting in potatoes, both in drills and in lazy beds, and I cannot even guess at a reason, why the dung should not be as quickly covered in one case as in the other; and I have been accustomed to see the lazy-bed manure covered just as soon as that in drills. On the contrary, with small farmers who have but one or two horses, this argument is all against the drills, as they must first use the horse in drawing out the manure and let it lie there until a sufficient quantity is out, and not until then can the horse be put into the plough to make the drills; but with the lazy-beds, as soon as the horse brings out the manure, it is spread and covered with the spade. And we must not forget, Mr. Editor, that this class of farmers comprises nineteen-twentieths of the farmers of Ireland. Again, Mr. Townsend","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"_ My own opinion, if it be of any value, is this—In a large farm (such as I suppose Mr. Towtisend holds), thorough-drained and subsoiled, with horse-work and labour at command, I would say that the drill-system is decidedly preferable, though I conceive that there are even here some peculiar advantages in lazy- beds. But in the case of a small farmer, with a limited quantity of manure, his land not thorough-drained and subsoiled (including perhaps 999 parts out of 1000 in Ireland), and mainly depending on his own labour and that of his family, I do believe that generally the lazy-bed system is more advantageous. There is this peculiar advantage in the lazy-bed, that it, in a great measure, supplies the place of subsoiling; and if, on potatoes being next set in the field, the trench be changed to what was the middle of the bed before, the subsoiling is almost complete. I have improved almost all my own fields, and cleared them of stones in this way; for subsoiling with the plough is so expensive as to have proved hitherto entirely out of the reach of small farmers. I have also observed, that after drill potatoes the undersoil becomes so hard and impervious from the frequent passing of the horses and plough over the surface, as to require the greatest difficulty in breaking it up. This I consider to be a very serious disadvantage. I apologize for troubling you, but have been led to do so from a desire to check a spirit of condemning whatever has the sanction of time.— :","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

The specimens sent are very fine; and had they not received the check they did on the 6th of February and this other now, there is no doubt but a full crop might have been ready to raise in May, as the two largest tubers are nearly as large as pigeon's eggs. The efforts which the stems have made to push below where the frost has injured them is most astonishing, each shoot is two inches Jong, producing, of course at the root, a proportionate amount of aorils, which in tneir turn will, no doubt, form a greater number of tubers, and which, on the aggregate, will be smaller, but, from past experience in a similar case, we have no doubt the crop will be heavier than those planted in spring. We are obliged to the “Knight of Kerry” for the trouble he has taken in sending the roots and will be happy to lay before our readers the ultimate result of this experiment, if he will have the goodness to communicate it.]","['Jong', None, 'Jong, Ireland']","Jong, Sandvika, Bærum, Akershus, 1336, Norge",hamlet,59.8935329,10.5026002,"['59.8735329', '59.9135329', '10.4826002', '10.5226002']"

"MY DEAR SIR—Your letter, of the 21st November, was received by me on the 20th instant, together with the printed slips on the subject of the potato disease, which it appears has occasioned great alarm in various parts of Europe. The summer of this year has certainly been most unpropitious to the «cultivation of the potato, not only in your country but in this, for our later crop has proved to be of inferior quality, and the produce has been scant; and, in many places, the disease in ques- tion has affected the tubers in the manner described in the British publications on the subject. With us a wet and cold season is greatly injurious to this vegetable- Frequent showers, when the plant is immature, are beneficial, but, when the tubers approach to maturity, temperate and dry weather is necessary to bring them to perfection. Had the last summer with you not been extraordinary for the quantity of rain which fell, and the low temperature of the atmosphere, you would have had no reason to complain of the scantiness of your crops, or of the destruction occasioned by the wet. In Pennsylvania we have two crops of potatoes; those planted in the opening of the spring, intended for summer use, and those planted about the latter end of May. Our first produce this year was most excellent; but the latter crop, as I have stated above, is of very inferior quality, occasioned, it is said, by superabundant wetness when the tubers had received their full growth. In the list of your printed queries, it is asked, ""Do plants die out?"" ""Is the potato dying out? I would answer, that I know no instance of plants dying out, nor do I believe that the potato is dying out; and, should your next summer be exempted from superabundant rains, and be favoured with more genial heat than the last, all your investigations, chemical, botanical, and entomological, will be found to be superfluous. Your may even spare yourselves the trouble of sending to America for seed, your own being infinitely better than any which we could furnish you with. It takes many years for potatoes to become acclimated. Should you plant exotic tubers, it is probable that you would have no reason to be satisfied with the result. In Pennsylvania the most esteemed kind is known under the name of Mercer; some of these were planted at my instance, by Charles Watterton, Esq., at Walton Hall, in Yorkshire, a few years ago, but the produce was not considered equal to that of the English varieties. I once made the experiment of planting for three years successively, the Irish variety, called rose potato; every care was taken to promote success; a suitable soil and exposure were selected, and the ordinary tillage was attended to with exactness. The first year the produce was inferior to the seed as respected quality; the next year an evident deterioration had taken place as to the quality and quantity; and the third year the product was of so little value that it was cast to the hogs. During all the three seasons mentioned, my Mercer potato exhibited no change. The present year here is remarkable for another accident in the vegetable kingdom. The European walnut (Juglans regia) presented a great display of fruit in the month of June, but a caleopterous insect had deposited its eggs in the green nuts in such quantities that, at the usual period of maturity, the kernels were found to be entirely destroyed.

"I am of opinion the question—should the drill system be universally adopted by the Irish farmers—ought to be considered with reference to their means and the extent of their holdings. By a late statistical. account, it appears that there are 685,309 farms in Ireland, of this number there is 306,915, or nearly one-half under five acres in extent, 251,123 more or about five-sixths that are less than 15 acres, from 15 to 30, 78,954, and above 30 only 48,312 or about one in fifteen. Now I would ask the advocates of drill husbandry, what means has fourteen out of every fifteen of Irish farmers got to carry out the principles of their system, how are they to deepen and subsoil their land, and put down their drills ? Very few of them can afford to keep but one horse, and I cannot see how they are to proceed except upon the defective system I have already pointed out. They surely would not recommend them to drill them with the spade to save labour, for that would involve double the expense without any of the benefit of the ridge system.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"Most of the epidemics which attack the vegetable, as well as the animal, kingdoms, have generally first made their appearance either on the Continent of Europe, or still farther east in Asia, their progress being from east to west; so that, if an epidemic similar to what occurred last year, should break but in these eastern countries, we can forestall its approach, and prevent it from doing much injury to our potato fields, either by raising the crop at once,- or breaking the communication between the atmosphere and the tubers, by cutting down the stems.- It is an undoubted fact that wherever the crop had been raised last year, or the stems had become withered, and the cellular tissue ceased to perform its functions, that the crop was free from disease. One instance with which we were made acquainted, proves the truth of the statement, that had all the stems been out down before the disease manifested itself, the whole of last year's crop of potatoes might have been saved. A farmer raised a few cart- loads of unripe potatoes from a field about three or four weeks before the disease appeared. These potatoes remained perfectly sound and free from taint all winter; whereas, those on the other part of the field—which had been allowed to remain in the field until after the disease had become general— were almost totally destroyed by it. This fact leads us to conclude, that there is no inherent disease in the potato itself; and also, that we may be able, in future, to guard against the ravages of epidemics by adopting the means above suggested.","['Asia', None, 'Asia, Ireland']",Asia,continent,51.2086975,89.2343748,"['26.2086975', '76.2086975', '64.2343748', '114.2343748']"

I am aware that several persons have already tried this, and I am doing so myself, having steeped some in a solution of salt in water, and am making preparation to try the sulphate of copper steep. :","['Highland', None, 'Highland, Ireland']","Highland, Alba / Scotland, United Kingdom",county,57.5066357,-5.0038367,"['56.4971546', '58.6975193', '-6.7897027', '-3.0239614']"

Although Ireland presents a somewhat remarkable coincidence of human suffering, and an excessive use of the potato as an article of diet, yet, to condemn the cultivation of it altogether on such grounds would be absurd. It is the abuse, and not the use of the potato as an article of food, that deserves reprobation. That the Irish peasant has carried the vise of potatoes to an extent extremely detrimental to the development of his muscular powers, cannot be denied; but as he has been accustomed all his life to ‘the potato as the main article of his daily subsistence, it would not merely be unwise, but most injurious to his health, were he to abandon suddenly that description of food upon which his body has been reared.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"300  small ribs or veins of the leaves, which burst and at once cause a small blotch, which runs like wild-fire into large brown, or black, inky-looking spots. I observed in the dull sunless weather we have had, previous to the last fourteen days, that the gangrene bursted blotchings were mostly brown; but since we have had clear sunny fervid weather, they at once turn as black as if charred. The disease is also to be discovered readily enough in the young tubers, if not before being cooked it may afterwards; the feel of an infected tuber will readily convince any one, although the disease may not be visible to the naked eye until the skin is peels off; the first appearance is its peculiar white colour, almost as white as a curd, and quite as soft. In others more infected may be observed the commencement of little sore looking watery blotchings full of water, as soon as the skin is removed; while in others, this may be found burst, and the disease clearly to be seen with the naked eye, passing all through the tuber in various directions; when thus infected, they soon become putrid. Whatever may have - been the origin or first cause of this destructive disease, it is clear that it now proceeds from the tuber—that its first appearance is, if either in tuber, stalk, or foliage, in the shape of little watery spots, pimples, or bulgings, swelling into a dropsical contortion until it burst, at which time the disease runs through the crop like wild-fire, carrying rapid destruction before it. It is now almost a certainty that the whole of the crops which have been planted at the usual season, and that too without any previous preparation of the seed-tuber will be again destroyed, whatever certainty there may be with prepared seed and early planting. Autumn planting, &c., will now soon prove itself; at present I have myself fine pieces of potatoes that have not at this moment any appearance of disease; under certain preparations at the same time, others have it in every form. I would recommend all cultivators to encourage crops of carrots, parsnips, Jerusalem artichokes; to sow plenty of turnips—more par- ticularly Swede turnips, which is one of the very best of all roots for horses, cows, bullocks, sheep, or pigs; they can now be sown in seed-beds, and transplanted in the same way as cabbages, and should the potato-crops fail, good varieties of cabbage should also be selected, and sown in abundance, and it is not too late for sowing dwarf curled savoys—a most excellent vegetable to stand a severe winter, and of known good qualities for furnishing abundance of wholesome food both for culinary purposes and for cattle. It is very good boiled or steamed for feeding pigs, &c. The potato disease being thus early discovered there is ample time to crop the land with articles that may be turned to good account in winter. It is not too late to sow carrots ; I have grown excellent crops sown after midsummer.

There are 4,000,000 of our population thus situated; and medical men estimate the daily quantity of Indian meal required to be about what will cost £9 per annum to supply a single labourer. I shall, however, in order to be considerably under, reduce the average so low as £5 per head. But even so, it becomes at once apparent that TWENTY MILLIONS OF MONEY should be remitted from this country annually, to feed, on Indian corn, that 4,000,000 of our people—while the average produce of our exports is but £8,000,000, and our whole average banking- circulation the same.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"This is sufficient to prove the impossibility; but, under any circumstances, to suppose that an agricultural country such as Ireland could relinquish the culture of a food most eminently fitted for its climate, and hope to supply itself with that which will not grow here, is, indeed, chimerical; and the sooner the people are made to understand the fact, that they must depend upon what they can produce themselves, the better; for they already too widely believe that Indian corn will, in future, be supplied for their use.—","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"sIR—As far as present appearances go, the fatal disease, called by the country people “potato cholera” is not hereditary. Much has been said and written on this head, calculated, in my mind, to do little more than deter poor people from planting the few potatoes which last year remained for such purposes, after the disease had run its course. I have been lately through the counties of Galway, Roscommon, Westmeath, Kildare, Dublin, Meath, Louth, and resident in this county (Longford), I can, now, from actual observation, and from having conversed, unreservedly, with the most intelligent practical, as well as scientific farmers throughout these counties, give a fair report of the various crops in general, but of the potato crops in particular, which, form the subject of this hastily, and, I fear, imperfectly written letter, and all agree with me, as I have already said, as far as present appearances go, we will have no ""potato cholera.” It is true, if similar causes occur this year as they did last year, we may expect similar results, that is, in as far as the habit and con- stitution of the growing crops may render them susceptible of being affected by such influence; or, on the contrary, proof against it. But as these causes are such as no human being can foresee, it would be presumption of the grossest kind to attempt to propound remedies beyond those already known from experience to be partially successful, for an imaginary evil we mayf ancy to be approaching as in the distance. But I shall not further weary you, or your readers, by such hypothetical assumptions, knowing, as I do, that one fact with you is worth a thousand unsupported statements. There is a potato starch manufactory in this town, the output from which amounted to some tons per day during the winter and spring, all of which was put out on a about three Irish acres, and so plentifully as to be two inches deep. Seed potatoes were planted, nay, pressed down into this strongly fermenting, and half decomposed mass of filth, and covered in the visual way. They grew successfully, and are now three to four inchesover ground, after being second earthed, and a more healthy crop of potatoes I have never seen at any season. It has been, by some, recommended to renew the potato crop, by obtaining fresh tubers from seed. As if by anticipation, 1 sowed in the year 1844 some seed of the old Irish white apple. I had the seed sown in the garden of Mr. Harris, at Knockmartin, (agent to the Rev. J. G. Porter, and others,) in the spring of 1845 ; the produce was planted in January, 1846, in drills, in the open ground, neither soil nor situation favourable, and the result has proved to be a healthy crop, and of early maturity, as you will perceive by the specimen I send you by the Sligo coach. you see they are well shaped, and of a ""standing yellow colour ;"" and, with your permission, I will call them Kellyites.

"308  potatoes—are used merely as a luxury, not only in Dublin but throughout the country. We are aware that very many men who, at one period of life, could not think of dining without potatoes, now express their determination never to eat a potato whilst price of that article remains so high, pledging themselves, as it were, against the use of them. It is always painful to a sensitive mind to be the bearer of sad intelligence. What intelligence, to an Irishman, of so sad a nature as that which we have conveyed ? But the sadness of the reflection is considerably lightened, when we look round us, and feel that we breathe in an atmosphere where the food of the people is untaxed. We now can speak of things that were, without being accused of having taken any part in the political revolutions that have taken place. Whatever the law is, we endeavour to act according to it, however we may approve or disapprove of its justice or injustice. The corn laws are now repealed. Will the prices be reduced so low as to bring on the farmers' ruin ? We believe not; we never believed they would; but even if they should become so low, we have another ""stone in our sleeve"" for that tyrant want. We have the means within our reach, by varying our systems, and making up in quantity what we lose by low price; for twenty barrels of wheat at 15s. per barrel, are better than fifteen barrels at 20s. per barrel; so let us ""be up and doing,"" for ""no good comes of idleness.”","['Dublin', None, 'Dublin, Ireland']","Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, Éire / Ireland",city,53.3493795,-6.2605593,"['53.2987342', '53.4105416', '-6.3870259', '-6.1148829']"

"Since we received the paper containing it, we have been through town and met several gentlemen, who one and all declare their crops to be greatly affected. We had also the pleasure of being called on by Mr. Hanly, the intelligent steward of Sir Roger Palmer, Kinnure Park, Rush, who states that his crops are much affected, but that his neighbours’ are still more so. He says that the poor people near Rush, who hitherto made their rents by the sale of early potatoes, are now, in getting out for market, leaving from one-fourth to one-half of them in the ground as worthless, as they did last year. He states, also, that an extensive farmer in his neighbourhood took out his ploughs, on last Tuesday, to earth his potatoes, and find them so deeply affected, he abandoned the work in despair; and that another tenant farmer had been busily engaged this week pulling up his potato stalks and transplanting mangel wurzel in their stead. We hope our friends through the country will state the condition of their crops.","['Kinnure Park', None, 'Kinnure Park, Ireland']",,,,,

"The all-absorbing topic, at the present time, appears to be the potato disease, which, as we last week anticipated, is now but too generally known.

"Knowing our countrymen as we so well do, we can sympathize with them to the fullest extent; and we hope they will, with us, use their strength, patience, and intelligence, in guarding against despondency, and bearing up against this temporary calamity, for it will be but temporary, and ultimately prove a blessing. It is even fortunate that it has so soon shown itself, that those in whose power, under Providence, it in to protect them, the poor, may take time by the forelock, and provide against contingency; and as Providence, in his wise dispensations, permits evils to befal us, that we may the better appreciate his blessings and be grateful for them, we should be thankful that we are not, as heretofore, in times of comparative plenty, afflicted with fever or other pestilential diseases, that swept away whole families. No, if we are to experience a temporary inconvenience, let us have fortitude in our distresses, which we, at least, do not anticipate to any great ex- tent—the more especially when we reflect on those; happy concomitant circumstances. An abundant harvest of corn and hay is everywhere expected, with very few exceptions.

"siR—I believe it is now generally, particularly, and universally known, and worse— felt, by all, that the potato crop is destroyed—a total failure. The sustenance for one half year of half of half of population, and the aid and assistant to other half, unprovided for. This revolution in the support and maintenance of a nation is an awful state, yet in the centre of this gastric revolution we all are this moment, and serious will be the consequences if some such mastermind as Sir Robert Peel does not make timely provision for the coming, I may say already arrived, emergency. In the electoral district where I live, every early potato field |! see, every one I hear of, are all withered, blasted, and perished, as much as they used to be in mid winter. The greatest care was taken in their planting and culture. In many cases whole potatoes taken out of pits in which no damage was seen to the potato last year, in extensive localities where the potato escaped the disease altogether last year, the same is the melancholy story in the early crop. The potatoes were a good deal grown before they were blasted, and if they are dug out at once and sold, there will be some present food, but the general opinion of the farmer is, that from the late crop, the minion (cup) and the lumper, there is little or no chance of any. I have seen several of these fields looking very luxuriant, until on a closer inspection the plague spot was manifest upon them; a black stripe on the stalk, a leaf here and","['lumper', None, 'lumper, Ireland']","Lumper, Lumperhof, Albertshofen, Ravensburg, Verwaltungsverband Mittleres Schussental, Landkreis Ravensburg, Baden-Württemberg, 88212, Deutschland",road,47.7732325,9.6316117,"['47.7725882', '47.7747514', '9.6293169', '9.6325533']"

"We last week hinted our fears that the relief about being afforded would fall short of its expected efficacy; and the more we consider it, the more those fears alarm us. We hinted at the danger of having the relief intended much lessened, by the support of the heavy staff machinery that government, in its' wisdom, will feel it ne- cessary to employ. We hinted that we could supply names, whose station would be a guarantee against fraudulent jobbing, whether it be Irish, English, or Scotch. The names we will now give, all must admit, are those that must be above suspicion; they are born for the people, they live for the people, and they must die under an awful responsibility, the conception of which can only be entertained by one of themselves—we mean the clergy, of every denomination. Those are the staff who know the people; who have hearts to feel for their wants, with which none else can be so intimately acquainted, and, as a consequence, can, better than any others, know how to redress them. We again call on the government—we call oil the executive, we call on the landed proprietors, we call on the middle men, we call on the working farmers, large and small, to consider before it be too late, the nature of our humble suggestion. Let a loan-fund be established in every parish in Ireland, to be supplied with a capital adequate to meet each contingency, and to be applied in such a manner as each respective case may imperatively demand. Do this in time, and there shall be nothing to fear of pestilence, famine, anarchy, or ruin. If you do not, or something very like it, you will meet one or all of the aforesaid evils. It may, as we have no doubt it will be, said, that dissensions, bickerings, or ill-blood may be engendered by the collision of such parties—that sectarian differences, prejudices, and partialities, would be the consequence. This, to some trifling extent, no doubt, may be justly feared, whilst human nature is human nature; but that any other staff can be so far above suspicion, from being so little actuated by worldly motives, few will have the hardihood to assert.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"I calculate that five out of the eight millions composing the population had their food or living by the potato, the remaining three millions being partly feed upon them, and the immense supply of pigs altogether, besides the aid afforded to support cows, horses, and poultry. Five millions of people, at the average of six to each family, will produce 833,333 families, which, as the rate of one acre of potatoes to each, and valuing fifth acre even at the low rate of £15 per acre, the loss to Ireland will be £12.000,000. I compute that half the 5,000,000, or 416.666 families, will require relief at the rate, at least, of 6lb. of meal per day to each family (averaging young and old), which, in twelve months, would amount to 407,355 tons, and at the rate of £10 per ton would cost £4,073,650.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"sIR—In a letter to Mr. Blacker, which, at his request, I allowed him to publish, I expressed a hope to be able, about this time, to bring the subject of providing suitable habitations for the poor, with allotments, before the public. I have given the subject much consideration, and I think, that any landlord desirous of improving his property, cannot be at a loss how to proceed, if he attentively reads over Mr. Slacker's prize essay, and Mr. Butler's, Mr. Prentice's, and Martin Doyle's essays on the amelioration of the condition of the Irish la-I bourer; but as these essays may not be within the reach of all, and may be considered by some too long to read, I would, through the medium of your widely-circulated Journal, very briefly endeavour to place before the landlords of Ireland a few plans or suggestions which, if carried out, would not only tend to develope the resources of the country, increase its produce, alter its appearance, but, to a great extent, meet the present trying emergency, in which al! are placed, and here I would request the most serious and attentive consideration of the landlords to the fact, that an act has just been passed, and I may say is already extensively about to be brought into operation, by which the land of the country may be taxed to an unlimited extent, for public works, and that one-half of the tax so to be raised must be borne by them; will they allow the scratching at hills system still to continue? or will they meet and co- operate with their tenants in making useful and permanent improvements mutually beneficial to both, and tending to develope the resources of the country. One or other alternative must be adopted—the people cannot starve, they must get immediate employment or they are in danger. The pians that I would suggest are—","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"In conclusion, I would venture to ask one simple question, would not the draining of wet and waste lands, and the improvement of the habitations of the poor, afford a better field for employment, than the system of public works which have for the last few months been carried on embracing very generally the lowering of hills, (and leaving the roads impassable) at a very heavy tax; for though the government gave half the cost, in reality the landholder is not benefitted. (I am sure the state is not much the better for the expenditure,) as the public works which have come under my notice, have, generally speaking, cost double what they could have been executed for by grand jury presentment. An allwise and all merciful Providence, has sent us a grievous visitation. The landlords of Ireland, the much aspersed and calumniated landlords, may turn this visitation to good account, they may show that they feel the responsibility of their position, and put to silence the evil report of those who, professing a sympathy for the people, really wish they were much worse than they describe them to be, in order that they might carry out their wild and mischievous objects. I have no fears for the result; if the landlords will act as becometh them, the government will assist them. An approving conscience with a trust in an all-wise and all-just Providence, will carry them through their difficulties, and the present visitation may be made the means of raising our unhappy but beloved country from its degraded position; that this may be the result; that the resources of the country may be developed ; the condition of the poor substantially ameliorated, and the happiness and prosperity of the entire community advanced, is the sincere wish and earnest prayer of—","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

Indeed the combined feelings of party had rendered it so even before the establishment of Mr. Monsell's great principle; and whatever may be the fate of the measure, when brought before headquarters, the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society has so far done its duty; the Viceroy has done or /s doing his, and an eternal debt of gratitude is due to the indefatigable zeal, persevering industry, superior practical intelligence, and well-tempered conduct. of Mr. Monsell on this very important and trying occasion—a debt which neither the government nor the country should forget to discharge. But, great and valuable as the establishment of this principle is, and likely as the government, no doubt, will be to ratify it, let no one suppose it will be sufficient for the wants and present circumstances of the country. No, we repeat it is a positive good, but a negative evil; for, great as the improvements must and will be under the change about to be effected, much more is still wanting, by all classes of the people, than what is contemplated even by this change in, we will say, a well-intended but unwise law. Had the landed proprietors of Ireland the means of effecting the improvements of their lands that now must take place, and had they their lands unencumbered by mortgages or annuitants that bind them down, there is no doubt but the increased productiveness of most of these lands would, before long, not only clear off all the expenses incurred by such improvements, but also, in many cases, add cent, per cent, to the proprietor’s rent- roll, and produce a corresponding benefit to the cultivators of the soil in every grade; increase the revenue of the country by increased prosperity amongst the merchants, manufactures, traders, and artisans. But the proprietors have no such means, nor have they the means of averting the evil which this, at present, neces- sary law will inflict on them; they are crippled by pecuniary embarrassments and","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

Indeed the combined feelings of party had rendered it so even before the establishment of Mr. Monsell's great principle; and whatever may be the fate of the measure, when brought before headquarters, the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society has so far done its duty; the Viceroy has done or /s doing his, and an eternal debt of gratitude is due to the indefatigable zeal, persevering industry, superior practical intelligence, and well-tempered conduct. of Mr. Monsell on this very important and trying occasion—a debt which neither the government nor the country should forget to discharge. But, great and valuable as the establishment of this principle is, and likely as the government, no doubt, will be to ratify it, let no one suppose it will be sufficient for the wants and present circumstances of the country. No, we repeat it is a positive good, but a negative evil; for, great as the improvements must and will be under the change about to be effected, much more is still wanting, by all classes of the people, than what is contemplated even by this change in, we will say, a well-intended but unwise law. Had the landed proprietors of Ireland the means of effecting the improvements of their lands that now must take place, and had they their lands unencumbered by mortgages or annuitants that bind them down, there is no doubt but the increased productiveness of most of these lands would, before long, not only clear off all the expenses incurred by such improvements, but also, in many cases, add cent, per cent, to the proprietor’s rent- roll, and produce a corresponding benefit to the cultivators of the soil in every grade; increase the revenue of the country by increased prosperity amongst the merchants, manufactures, traders, and artisans. But the proprietors have no such means, nor have they the means of averting the evil which this, at present, neces- sary law will inflict on them; they are crippled by pecuniary embarrassments and","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"O  This besides destroying one of their chief means of paying rent, (and requiring a greater quantity of land for their subsistence) would be fatal to the progress of good husbandry; and, as every practical agriculturist is aware, must, if persevered in for four or five years, end in failure and disappointment, and then many years of judicious and scientific treatment will be required to restore to land so mismanaged, its capacity for producing grain. In order, therefore, to prevent recourse to a foreign market, on the one hand, or on the other, to the uninterrupted repetition of white crops on the same soil, either of which would, in my opinion, be fatal to the best interests of agriculture, and, consequently, of the population of this country, I would suggest, that the small farmers of Ireland should for the future, employ their manure in the growth, in due proportions of parsnips, peas, and beans, for their own consumption, and of turnips for that of their stock, to be followed as heretofore, by grain crops, &c. I purpose, if permitted, to suggest in your next number, what it appears to me these proportions should be, so as that an equal, if not a greater amount of more nutritious food shall be raised off the same extent of land, and with the application of only the same quantity of manure; but for the present, I must stop as I fear to trespass too much on your space, and on the patience of your readers. But spare me a few lines byway of conclusion; you have suggested a ""makeshift"" which ought to lie permanently adopted: allow me to suggest one, which might be of use to the small farmers in the approaching season of famine, but which certainly ought not fo be permanently adopted, viz., to sow five or six pounds of parsnip seed to the Irish acre, on their potato soil, and harrow it in now with their winter, and in February and March, with their spring corn.—","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"O  When the case was brought before the government by the Lord Lieutenant, we lamented the wrong direction in which the act had been turned; but, admitting the necessity of the case, and anxious to obtain the willing co-operation of the landlords, we authorised the Lord Lieutenant to deviate from the letter of the law and gave our sanction for advances for useful and profitable works of a private nature. But, after having incurred this responsibility, I am sorry to see that, in several parts of Ireland, calls are made upon the government to undertake and perform tasks which are beyond the power, and apart from the duties of government.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"For instance—it seems to be expected that we should not only pay at an unusual rate of wages, but that we should maintain, in this time of scarcity, the usual price of food. A moment's thought will show that this is impossible. A smaller quantity of food is to be divided among the same number of human beings. It must be scarcer—it must be dearer. Any attempt to feed one class of the people of the United Kingdom by the government would, if successful, starve another part—would feed the producers of potatoes, which had failed, by starving the producers of wheat, barley, and oats, which had not failed. All that we have under- taken with regard to food, therefore, is to endeavour to create a provision trade, at fair mercantile prices, where no provision trade has hitherto existed, and where, without assistance, none might be willing to undertake a new and unpopular occupation.","['the United Kingdom', None, 'the United Kingdom, Ireland']","The (Oval) Banqueting Suite, 372, Stratford Road, Sparkhill, Sparkbrook, Birmingham, West Midlands Combined Authority, England, B11 4AB, United Kingdom",building,52.45777545,-1.869209938214711,"['52.4576816', '52.4580336', '-1.8696421', '-1.8688657']"

"It has been calculated that one-fifth of the cultivated land in Ireland has hitherto produced potatoes. After the present lamentable failure, what course is to be taken ? Some men of science deem that the potato can no longer be depended upon as an article of food; others say that time may remove the disease. The editor of the Gardener's Chronicle states that the explanation of the potato disease,","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"358  founded on the hypothesis of some unknown miasma, cannot be accepted as satisfactory: but, neither can it be rejected, seeing how signally all other explanations have failed. Seeing, then, that science furnishes us with no means of estimating the effects of the prevalent disease upon the potato plant in future years, it would be impossible for the government, with any propriety, to give any advice to the owners or occupiers of land in Ireland. They must form their own conclusions from the facts that are known, and the experience of the present and past years.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"it is clear, however, that potatoes cannot be relied upon as they have been hitherto, a cottier cannot hope to be able to pay a large rent for con-acre, and the farmer cannot hope to obtain the coitier's labour by allowing him land for potatoes, which may, probably fail. It is, therefore, a most important question for the people of Ireland, in what manner the deficiency of food is in future to be supplied. The nature of the grain or root which is best adapted for this purpose—the course of husbandry which ought to be followed—the means of procuring seed—all these are important problems, to which the attention of the Agricultural Society of Ireland cannot too _ soon be directed. ;","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"One thing is certain—in order to enable Ireland to maintain her population, her agriculture must be greatly improved. Cattle, corn, poultry, pigs, eggs, butter, and salt provisions, have been, and will probably continue to be, her chief articles of export.

"Sir — As it is the important study and consideration of every good landlord in Ireland how he can employ the distressed population of his locality, I consider it . the duty of every practical and experienced agriculturist to give his opinion on how they could be most usefully employed, particularly on what works will best remunerate for the cost of labour. I beg to make a few observations relative to some work that I have had executed, and which I can prove to have more than doubly paid for the cost— it is on the great value of trenching the land. I have done some business for a gentleman in the county Monaghan these last few years—Mr. Thomas Gartlan — who had part of his land set to tenants; those tenants wore out the land by constant tillage and bad management, the result of which was, that they had to give the land up, being two years in arrears of rent. Mr. Gartlan was kind enough to forgive the arrears and take the land off their hands. The land at this time was not able to produce six barrels of oats to the acre. Mr. Gartlan immediately began to trench an ""entire farm of 20 acres 14 inches deep, and gave it about HO barrels of lime per acre when trenched. It is now tilled on the four-course rotation, and, to my knowledge, is at present able to produce from 14 to 16 barrels of wheat per acre; and 40 tons of turnips, and, of course, will be every year","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"No man can dispute that work which will give such a return would be a most profitable way of employing the people. There is not a locality in Ireland where there could not be sufficient employment made out for the people, and in such ways, if superintened by practical men, would return more than £4 per cent, for the money expended. A great part of the tenantry could do the same work as well as the landlords, if they were only to know the value of it. Any land requiring draining should be first drained: this is the proper time of the year to do such work, as the land is free from crops, and so soft, that the work can be done with much less cost than when the ground gets dry. Another great benefit derived from trenching is the banishing of couch grass or any other weeds which the ground is subject to, and is much easier tilled than before, so much so that it will take fewer horses.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"©  but when the matter was subsequently brought before the society on one or two occasions, it was always interrupted by a reference to the 14th general rule.

Now, although this took place in a meeting of the council of the society, consisting of 40 member's, as he had said, gentlemen subsequently got up to obstruct their proceedings when reference was made to Mr. Monsell's motion; and it was owing to this obstruction that they considered it necessary to call a general meeting, to have the question formally settled—to have the society finally declare whether or not it would consent then to have done what the council had frequently done (hear, hear). The amount of the sum that should be raised to supply the consequences resulting from the loss of the potato was immense (hear, hear); and if that large sum was to be expended on roads, bridges, aqueducts, and unproductive works, at a time when the reproduction of the land was called for, it would alarm him and others as to the ultimate consequences to the country.

Such was the extent of the loss sustained by the country (hear, hear)—and it was well known that it would take three acres of corn to supply, as an article of food, one of potatoes; so that the produce of 3,900,000 acres of corn would be required to supply the loss of 1,300,000 of potatoes (hear, hear). Now, if there were to be an expenditure of money to be raised off the land, and that that money was not to be reproductively expended— that they were to go on with a compulsory taxation for the employment of the people on unproductive and useless works (loud cries of hear, hear)—and that the money was to go out of the country to buy foreign food, the matter would be soon wound up (hear, hear).

"I beg to say that I concur in the objects of the requisionists. I am of opinion, that by the suspension of the 14th rule of the society, much useful discussion might take place among persons the best qualified to afford to the government such information in reference to the profitable and reproductive employment of the people, as may be necessary in the present emergency. I would suggest, however, that the proposed suspension of the 14th rule should be strictly limited to a certain period, (say six months, or until the next general meeting of the society,) and that the ordinary business of council should be invariably disposed of before any questions heretofore excluded by the said rule be introduced. The relaxation of the rule will thus be unaccompanied with any risk, or should it be found after the present crisis shall have passed to have been fraught with any danger to the usefulness of the society, the rule will, at the expiration of the proposed period, revive in all its stringency. I cannot, however, but think that in a country circumstanced as Ireland is, i.e., dependent wholly upon its agriculture, and that agriculture in the greatest need of encouragement and wise direction, it would be most advantageous that there should be a recognised body, to which, upon special occasions, and upon questions of such practical import, as, for instance, the employment of the agricultural population, the government could refer for information; and, inasmuch as the society does or ought to include among its members, all who are in a position to promote the industrial welfare of the country, I think it would both strengthen the hands and improve the usefulness of the institution to permit, with proper limitations, the discussion generally of subjects having a direct and practical bearing upon agricultural improvement.

"Mr. La Touche said he would move that the society should strictly adhere to the 14th rule, that no question should be discussed at any of their meetings having a political tendency. A great deal however, had been said by Mr. Roper, in which he agreed, yet he thought it would be opening a loop-hole to the introduction of subjects that would inevitably destroy their society, because in a country so situated as Ireland was, there were no subjects so exciting as those of a political. character; and the politics of this country were so interwoven with agriculture, that if they debated the tendencies of acts of parliament, division and discussion amongst them, must inevitably be the consequence. Their society was doing great good, and he begged of the gentlemen around him net to be precipitate, but to consider before they abolished a fundamental rule upon which they had worked so far, and which was essential to the proper working of the society.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

The number if electoral divisions in Ireland is about 2,050, containing a large number of townlands, chiefly in the hands of separate proprietors, of whom many are absentees, whose consent it is almost impossible to obtain; others are lunatics or infants, or strict tenants for life, in which cases, there are many difficulties and impediments to obtaining the required guarantee; whilst some may be in such embarrassed circumstances, that the whole rental of their property is absorbed in payment of interest money and expenses ; or a few proprietors may prefer a public road to private works, and by their opposition, counteract the wishes of the majority for ;he adoption of reproductive Works, in their elec-;oral division.

"As we never wished to assert anything we are not prepared to prove, we will give one example to show that our information, obtained from Mr. Mulvany, was not to be relied upon, or, otherwise, that his officers are retarding the work he has so anxiously and so ably undertaken, In the barony of Ikeathy, in the county of Kildare several meetings of the gentry, and many of cess-payers took place to consider how the people could be employed and kept from starvation.

"O  sessions, which took place on Monday the 23d inst. at the petty sessions’ house at Donadea. The magistrates present were Sir Gerald G. Aylmer, Bart., Sir William Hart, Bart., the Honourable Edward Lawless. Captain Aylmer, ?. Coates, Esq., ?. Kearney, Esq., &c., with many of the highly respectable cess-payers who reside in this Barony. There also attended the county surveyor, Mr. Yeates, who is reputed to be a superior engineer, an upright man, and we know, of our own knowledge, a gentleman of great practical intelligence. There attended, on the part of the government, a very elegant and accomplished young gentleman, named, as far as we could learn, Captain or Mr. Brandy. The number of the unemployed men in the barony having been ascertained to be 212, it was resolved to vote a sum of something over £2,000, or one 15th of the entire valuation of the barony, to employ them for three months. The Hon. Edward Lawless, in that spirit which characterises all his actions, so well worthy the son of Lord Cloncurry, patriotically and philosophically pressed on the meeting the necessity of employing the people, so few in number compared to other places of distress, without taxing the property of the barony to an enormous amount, to support a staff of government officers, and in doing so, put a very legitimate question to the officer in attendance—namely, what amount of the taxation should go to the officers ? The gentleman replied, ""Oh, a mere trifle; about one-seventh. Remembering Mr. Mulvany's answer to ourselves, and being determined to test this gentleman's authority for stating ""one-seventh,"" we gave the answer as Mr. Mulvany gave it to us, and as we have before given to the public. The young gentleman replied—""The Board of Works have a great objection to allow stewards to drain land under them, believing they do not under- stand such work."" Indignant at such an assumption, we told him what we now repeat for his information and that of the Board of Works, but more especially for the information of the landed proprietors, whose property is at stake, that there are hundreds of stewards in Ireland at the present time who understand the practical, effectual, and economical draining of land better than any one of the juvenile so- called engineers; and we again call on the landed proprietors to protect their properties from being swallowed up by such a staff.

"O  sessions, which took place on Monday the 23d inst. at the petty sessions’ house at Donadea. The magistrates present were Sir Gerald G. Aylmer, Bart., Sir William Hart, Bart., the Honourable Edward Lawless. Captain Aylmer, ?. Coates, Esq., ?. Kearney, Esq., &c., with many of the highly respectable cess-payers who reside in this Barony. There also attended the county surveyor, Mr. Yeates, who is reputed to be a superior engineer, an upright man, and we know, of our own knowledge, a gentleman of great practical intelligence. There attended, on the part of the government, a very elegant and accomplished young gentleman, named, as far as we could learn, Captain or Mr. Brandy. The number of the unemployed men in the barony having been ascertained to be 212, it was resolved to vote a sum of something over £2,000, or one 15th of the entire valuation of the barony, to employ them for three months. The Hon. Edward Lawless, in that spirit which characterises all his actions, so well worthy the son of Lord Cloncurry, patriotically and philosophically pressed on the meeting the necessity of employing the people, so few in number compared to other places of distress, without taxing the property of the barony to an enormous amount, to support a staff of government officers, and in doing so, put a very legitimate question to the officer in attendance—namely, what amount of the taxation should go to the officers ? The gentleman replied, ""Oh, a mere trifle; about one-seventh. Remembering Mr. Mulvany's answer to ourselves, and being determined to test this gentleman's authority for stating ""one-seventh,"" we gave the answer as Mr. Mulvany gave it to us, and as we have before given to the public. The young gentleman replied—""The Board of Works have a great objection to allow stewards to drain land under them, believing they do not under- stand such work."" Indignant at such an assumption, we told him what we now repeat for his information and that of the Board of Works, but more especially for the information of the landed proprietors, whose property is at stake, that there are hundreds of stewards in Ireland at the present time who understand the practical, effectual, and economical draining of land better than any one of the juvenile so- called engineers; and we again call on the landed proprietors to protect their properties from being swallowed up by such a staff. Just, gentle reader, for a moment think of £14 or £15 sterling being swallowed up by those gentlemen out of every hundred pounds that must come out of the people's pocket to feed the starving population; and; when we say £14 or £15 out of every hundred pounds we have no guarantee that the amount to be so swallowed up may not be twice or thrice that sum. In addition to which, the useless expenditure of money by these inexperienced young or o/d men (we care not whether they be young or old, when we know they are inexperienced) will, in many cases, be 100 percent. higher than it need be; nay, there will be money spent in profusion on land that in all probability does not require draining at all, except in as far as it will enable speculators to drain the unfortunate proprietor's purse, and send himself and his posterity to beggary.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"The thanks of the country are due the Hon. Edward Lawless; for were it not for his question put the other day at the meeting in the barony of Ikeathy, the undercurrent influence of these itinerant so-called engineers would undermine a good deal of the property of the country, and keep the people in actual starvation, whilst their object would be to secure jobs for themselves, in the hope that when the property of the country would be about to change hands they would come in for the lion's share.","['Ikeathy', None, 'Ikeathy, Ireland']","Ikeathy and Oughterany, County Kildare, Leinster, Éire / Ireland",barony,53.36426705,-6.726979328097396,"['53.2993576', '53.4291679', '-6.8154883', '-6.6357477']"

"O  fungical science, electrical lore, human skill; certain it is, however, as has been already premised, that early planting may, and will, prove the most effectual means of escaping the blight; and fortunate it is that the remedy is so simple and easily applied. Great caution in planting will be required to be exercised so as to insure the safety of the seed, and, consequently, the future crops. It is to be feared that few will make the experiment at all this year, apprehensive that it may end in disappointment. I could not, indeed, vouch for the security of such as have not been as yet put down; for whoever has observed the few healthy potatoes that were fortunately rescued from disease, cannot fail to have witnessed the rapidity with which they are pushing forth young shoots. Now, it were well, had this been taken advantage of sufficiently early, and the potatoes been consigned to their last resting-place, the latter having been first thoroughly prepared for their reception. It is to be desired that those potatoes in Dublin and elsewhere, which have been imported this season, be carefully handled, and kept from growing prematurely. It is time, at all events, they were bought up by those who intend to make use of them as seed; for it is to be feared that they will not receive that careful and delicate treatment which their much-debilitated constitutions require. Let me not be misunderstood when I say, delicate treatment. Perhaps it were better to consult nature, or, rather, their nature, and if they are to be kept over, prefer a situation, or medium, somewhat of the same temperature as the soil. Here they will not be so liable to spoil. No more wasteful or injurious situation could be chosen than a loft or boarded floor. It is entirely out of character with what should be the intention of the grower. A cool, but not too damp a medium, is decidedly to be preferred.","['Dublin', None, 'Dublin, Ireland']","Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, Éire / Ireland",city,53.3493795,-6.2605593,"['53.2987342', '53.4105416', '-6.3870259', '-6.1148829']"

Two subjects necessarily came before this committee, which pressed immediately on their attention the awful state of famine in the country, and the equally terrific waste of the public resources (hear, hear and theers).

The meeting he had then the honor of addressing was the most important assemblage of the landed proprietors of this afflicted country which had ever assembled in Ireland, and they had met for purposes of considering the distress under which the entire country was suffering, and by which great numbers of the people were already starving (hear, hear).

He stated, it as his opinion that that meeting should not be held for the purpose of speech making, but rather for those of consultation, deliberation, and action (cheers). Impressed with that conviction, he would not occupy their time by making a speech on that occasion, although the resolution he had the honor of proposing afforded a tempting opportunity of doing so, and in recommending the formation of an Irish party he would be only acting upon a foregone conclusion, for the Irish party was already formed (cheers), and all there was now wanted was a little organisation to make that party effective in both houses of the legislature (hear and cheers).

The following is the resolution:—""That before and beyond all other con- siderations is the salvation of the lives of the people—and we therefore deem it our solemn duty—the present system having signally failed—to call upon the government in the most imperative terms to take such measures as will secure local supplies of food sufficient to keep the people alive; and to sacrifice any quantity of money that may be deemed necessary to attain that object, declaring, as we do, that any neglect or delay in that matter will render ""the government responsible for"" the safety of the people of Ireland, who must perish in multitudes unless supplied with food. That as the people of this country are suffering from a most extraordinary and incalculably ex- tensive deficiency in the stock of food, we further call upon the government to remove all artificial impediments to the supply of that deficiency, by the temporary suspension of the Navigation Laws, and the duties on the importation of corn, and also to give increased facilities to that importation by permitting such vessels of her Majesty's navy as can be spared to be employed in the transport of provisions. That we consider it would be most desirable that the unrestricted use of sugar and molasses in our breweries and distilleries should be permitted under existing circumstancess, in order to save for more useful purposes a portion of the grain now used in those establish- ments. That we recommend that relief committees should be allowed to sell food under first cost to the destitute in their respective neighbourhoods, and that their doing so should not disentitle them to government contributions in aid of their funds"" (hear, hear).","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

"Lord Milton proposed the next resolution, as follows— ""That to absorb surplus labour, and at the same time to increase the food produce of the country, piers and harbours for fishery purposes, and model curing-houses, with salt depots attached, should be established along the coast. That with the like object of absorbing labour, and increasing our food supplies, a systematic plan should be adopted for the reclamation of waste lands throughout the country. That in any such system an option should be given to the proprietors of waste lands to undertake the reclamation themselves; and, in order to enable them to do so, means should be placed at their disposal for obtaining public loans for that purpose—the security of such loans to be confined to the land improved—and (subject to due protection of reversionary interests)—every possible facility should be afforded them of alienating their waste lands for the purpose of reclamation. That with the further view of absorbing labour, our representatives be instructed to lay claim to such expenditure upon works and objects of a national character—such as naval dock yards, safety harbours, and packet stations, as ought of right to be allotted to this country. That in addition to these measures a scheme of systematic colonization would, in our opinion, provide the means of subsistence, to a large portion of our destitute population—would relieve many districts in this country which are now unable to support their inhabitants—would benefit the colonies by supplying them with labour—would increase the supply of food throughout the world by bringing fresh land into cultivation—and would largely extend the market for home manufactures. That the class which it is desirable to see emigrating cannot do so by their own resources; and that no one of the other classes benefited by the operation would, separately-taken, find it so profitable as to insure their carrying it out upon a large scale. That it is, therefore, peculiarly the province of the state which represents and protects the interests of all collectively, to promote emigration by direct intervention, as well as by assisting, with information and pecuniary aid, the efforts of individuals and public bodies in promoting this most desirable result (near, hear). In doing so he said he did not wish to disturb the unanimity of the meeting by expressing his particular. views upon some matters which were brought forward; yet, he could not but state that he did not fully approve of all that had been put forward (hear, hear); for instance, he did not consider some of the resolutions applicable to Ireland; and, as to other matters introduced, he thought that, perhaps, they did not go far enough (hear,","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

That with a like object we also recommend that tenants, with the consent of their landlord, should have power to apply for public loans in the same manner as the proprietor himself, and to charge the lands improved with the repayment of the money advanced, the tenant rendering himself responsible for the annual installments that shall accrue during the period of his occupation; and that in order to encourage the investment of the tenant's own capital upon his land, his right to compensation for permanent improvements, in case of his removal, should be recognised by law"" (hear, hear). He said that in his opinion the Labour Act, the 9th and 10th of Victoria, would never have been passed to confiscate the property of the Irish landlords—for that would be its effect if it was to be continued—if such a party as had been formed that day had been formed at an earlier period (hear).","['Victoria', None, 'Victoria, Ireland']","Victoria, Australia",state,-36.5986096,144.6780052,"['-39.1984867', '-33.9807974', '140.9619017', '150.0332821']"

"But loudly as we may call, we know our voice will be inaudible to our rulers, or too unimportant to arrest their attention; but, when we echo (and we glory fully to echo) the plain but powerful language of the meeting of the 14th, who call upon the government in the most imperative terms to take such measures as will secure local supplies, afford sufficient to keep the people alive, and to sacrifice any quantity of money that may be necessary to attain that object. And also declare that any neglect, or delay, in that matter will render the government responsible for the safety of the people of Ireland, who must perish in multitudes unless supplied with food. We cannot but assure ourselves that the call will not be in vain. Not only that famine, and its countless awful concomitants will be now averted, but that long-looked-for and most extensive and permanent ameliorations, which before we could only see come round slowly and gradually, will be now speedily and simultaneously effected.

Remember, lauded proprietors, whatever your titles or stations in life may be, that your country is a vast charnalhouse into which Providence has been pleased to permit her to fall — that she, if well cultivated, and her resources fully developed, would be as free from the desolation of famine as she is from the poison of the snake.

I feel sure that this House from the temper which it has already displayed; from the sense which it has manifested of the calamity which has occurred, and I fear calamities still impending; from the sense of the danger that there would be from interposing any party feeling in the discussion of this subject; from the kindly disposition with which I have been already received by the House,—I feel sure, I say, that on this occasion I need not ask for any such indulgence, but that it will be voluntarily bestowed upon me. Sir, in considering the state of Ireland, I will first proceed with laying down what is the order in which I wish to discuss the subject. In the first place I propose to state generally the condition of those parts of the United Kingdom in which this calamity has occurred; secondly, to make a general statement of what has occurred during the recess of parliament; what has been done in consequence of Acts of Parliament; how far those measure have succeeded; how far I think they have been deficient, and then to state what we will proceed to do for the general emer- gency. After having made that statement, I shall ask the attention of the house while I proceed to invite them to some consideration of other measures which are calculated, in the opinion of her majesty's government to improve the state of Ireland, and to lay the foundation for her permanent welfare and tranquility. I shall then take the liberty of mentioning some other subjects which, although they have been under consideration, have not received a full discussion.

Scarcely one class of the working population are permanently beyond the condition of pauperism (hear, and cheers). In the third report of the same commission, which, with the others, go to form the general report of the commissioners, the following facts are given:—lIt appears that in Great Britain agriculture constitutes one-fourth of the business of the people, whereas in Ireland it forms two-thirds. In 1831 the number of persons engaged in agriculture in Great Britain was 1,651,000; in Ireland it was 1,131,715. At the same time while Great Britain had 34,360,000 acres in cultivation, Ireland had but 14,600,000. Ireland had, therefore, in proportion to its extent, five agricultural ‘labourers for Great Britain's one. At the same time, while in Ireland the wages of the labourer was from 6d. to 9d. a day, it was, in Great Britain, from 2s. to 2s. 6d. When Parliament met last year, it was apprehended that the potato crop having been much injured, there was about to be a great scarcity in Ireland. That apprehension was not fully justified by the event. It was impossible, as I think, for any man exactly to see what the extent of the misfortune would be; but I also think that having had a very plentiful crop of potatoes in the previous year, although there was no great quantity of the potato much injured, yet the quantity of food in Ireland was not very deficient. However, Parliament took means very early in the session, for the supply of food for the destitute, by means of giving work on roads and public works. It was enacted by Parliament, that at the request of the sessions in a barony, parties should be empowered to advance money from the Treasury in loans for the execution of these works. Under this law the Government, on the 31st of August, voted a sum of £1,373,000 for the relief of distress, by the creation of public works. There were presentments made to the amount of £476,000 for these works, and out of this sum £290,000 was actually expended. Before the end of the last session of Parliament, on the recommendation of the present Government, Parliament passed a further Act, by which, on the one hand, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was permitted to order presentment sessions, and on the other hand, in order to check an extravagant expenditure, it was determined that these sums should only be granted by way of loan, and the money was to be repaid to the Treasury. The poor rates in the last five years had increased from £4,000,000 to £5,000,000, being an increase of a million and upwards; and I do not believe from the mode in which that million had been expended, that any great amount of productive labour has been engaged, but that that sum has been employed in the partial and inefficient relief of local distress. The noble lord in referring to the Public Works in Ireland said—as the plan went on the number of the distressed persons increased, and with the number of the distressed, the difficulties of providing employment for such a number also increased. I should say, in the present place, that as the business of the Board of Works went on the officers, found that they had also great difficulty of obtaining trustworthy and efficient persons to act under them. It was found in the first place that the labourers were frequently unwilling to undertake the tasks allotted to them. At length this difficulty pressed itself upon those engaged to such an extent, that the belief prevailed, that it was impossible for any public board to fully discharge its duties and to carry out the works. The number on the establishment has been gradually increasing. I will not read their names, but the total number of persons employed as officiate under this board is, at the present moment, 11.587; the number of superintendents is 185; the amount expended for the payment of all in debt contracted is £2,410,366.

In 1831 the number of persons engaged in agriculture in Great Britain was 1,651,000; in Ireland it was 1,131,715. At the same time while Great Britain had 34,360,000 acres in cultivation, Ireland had but 14,600,000. Ireland had, therefore, in proportion to its extent, five agricultural ‘labourers for Great Britain's one. At the same time, while in Ireland the wages of the labourer was from 6d. to 9d. a day, it was, in Great Britain, from 2s. to 2s. 6d. When Parliament met last year, it was apprehended that the potato crop having been much injured, there was about to be a great scarcity in Ireland. That apprehension was not fully justified by the event. It was impossible, as I think, for any man exactly to see what the extent of the misfortune would be; but I also think that having had a very plentiful crop of potatoes in the previous year, although there was no great quantity of the potato much injured, yet the quantity of food in Ireland was not very deficient. However, Parliament took means very early in the session, for the supply of food for the destitute, by means of giving work on roads and public works. It was enacted by Parliament, that at the request of the sessions in a barony, parties should be empowered to advance money from the Treasury in loans for the execution of these works. Under this law the Government, on the 31st of August, voted a sum of £1,373,000 for the relief of distress, by the creation of public works. There were presentments made to the amount of £476,000 for these works, and out of this sum £290,000 was actually expended. Before the end of the last session of Parliament, on the recommendation of the present Government, Parliament passed a further Act, by which, on the one hand, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was permitted to order presentment sessions, and on the other hand, in order to check an extravagant expenditure, it was determined that these sums should only be granted by way of loan, and the money was to be repaid to the Treasury. The poor rates in the last five years had increased from £4,000,000 to £5,000,000, being an increase of a million and upwards; and I do not believe from the mode in which that million had been expended, that any great amount of productive labour has been engaged, but that that sum has been employed in the partial and inefficient relief of local distress. The noble lord in referring to the Public Works in Ireland said—as the plan went on the number of the distressed persons increased, and with the number of the distressed, the difficulties of providing employment for such a number also increased. I should say, in the present place, that as the business of the Board of Works went on the officers, found that they had also great difficulty of obtaining trustworthy and efficient persons to act under them. It was found in the first place that the labourers were frequently unwilling to undertake the tasks allotted to them. At length this difficulty pressed itself upon those engaged to such an extent, that the belief prevailed, that it was impossible for any public board to fully discharge its duties and to carry out the works.

In 1831 the number of persons engaged in agriculture in Great Britain was 1,651,000; in Ireland it was 1,131,715. At the same time while Great Britain had 34,360,000 acres in cultivation, Ireland had but 14,600,000. Ireland had, therefore, in proportion to its extent, five agricultural ‘labourers for Great Britain's one. At the same time, while in Ireland the wages of the labourer was from 6d. to 9d. a day, it was, in Great Britain, from 2s. to 2s. 6d. When Parliament met last year, it was apprehended that the potato crop having been much injured, there was about to be a great scarcity in Ireland. That apprehension was not fully justified by the event. It was impossible, as I think, for any man exactly to see what the extent of the misfortune would be; but I also think that having had a very plentiful crop of potatoes in the previous year, although there was no great quantity of the potato much injured, yet the quantity of food in Ireland was not very deficient. However, Parliament took means very early in the session, for the supply of food for the destitute, by means of giving work on roads and public works. It was enacted by Parliament, that at the request of the sessions in a barony, parties should be empowered to advance money from the Treasury in loans for the execution of these works. Under this law the Government, on the 31st of August, voted a sum of £1,373,000 for the relief of distress, by the creation of public works. There were presentments made to the amount of £476,000 for these works, and out of this sum £290,000 was actually expended. Before the end of the last session of Parliament, on the recommendation of the present Government, Parliament passed a further Act, by which, on the one hand, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was permitted to order presentment sessions, and on the other hand, in order to check an extravagant expenditure, it was determined that these sums should only be granted by way of loan, and the money was to be repaid to the Treasury. The poor rates in the last five years had increased from £4,000,000 to £5,000,000, being an increase of a million and upwards; and I do not believe from the mode in which that million had been expended, that any great amount of productive labour has been engaged, but that that sum has been employed in the partial and inefficient relief of local distress.

"O  30,135 in September last to 440,687 in December. In the last week's account they were stated at more than 480,000; and at the present time, I do not doubt but that the number amounts to half a million. I do not doubt but that great ability must be engaged in the employment of this number of persons. It is calculated that five persons gain subsistence for every person that is employed. I cannot say that this statement is correct; but taking it at four persons, there will be upwards of two millions of people supported by this plan. The expense at the same time must be enormous, and from an estimate I have here drawn up, it appears that the expense in the first week of December was £140,000, the second £156,000, the third £158.000, and the fourth £154,000. So far as we are acquainted with the past three weeks of January, the expense of the first week was £157,000; on the 9th January, it was £156,000; and on the 16th, £172,000; making an amount of £585,000 for the month of December, and £485,000 for the first three weeks of Jan., and it is calculated that the expense of the whole of this month will be between £700,000 and £800,000. Sir, it is the opinion of the advisers of her Majesty, that it will be desirable to form district relief committees, which committees shall be empowered to receive subscriptions, to levy rates, and to receive donations from the government; and that by this means they should be enabled to purchase food, to establish soup depots, or that they should as far as they were able, distribute relief, to the famishing applicants, and that they should not require this indispensable test of work, but that a labouring man should be allowed to work upon his own plot of ground or on the farmers, and thus his labour would, tend to benefit the approaching harvest, and, perhaps, by such an arrangement, he might be enabled to earn some small trifle in addition to the relief afforded him by the committee. After we had considered this scheme, I communicated it to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and also to the various officers of the Board of Works and the Commissariat Department; they are prepared to consider it favourably, and we will endeavour, by a series of preparatory measures, and next by a bill, to carry into effect the arrangement. We propose that these arrangements shall be carried out under the superintendence ol a gentleman, who has had extensive experience of public works. The person to whom I allude is Sir John Barrow, at the present time the Inspector-General of fortifications in this country. I sent for him the other day, for the first time, and having explained to him what we wanted, he said he would obtain leave of absence from his present duties; and, instead of devoting the time to relaxation, he would consider it his duty to devote it to the services of the country, and that he would be ready to go to Ireland at any time when called on. That gentleman will be in communication with the Lord Lieutenant, and will co-operate or not, as he thinks best, with the Board of Works, with the commissions of the Poor-law—with the heads of the constabulary force—and with any other parties in Ireland that may be calculated to assist him. The question with regard to proposing this measure as one of immediate relief, and for the more efficiently supplying the people with food who are in want, will be treated in connection with what has been done already; while everything will be done to give speedy effect to the operation of this measure: at the same time, care will be taken, and the Lord Lieutenant will see to it, that its substitution for the system of public works, already in operation, shall be easy of transition.

I think that the misfortune was so severe that, passing by the remote causes of it, we ought not to throw the full burden of it on the possessors of property in Ireland. It would be right that the whole of the burden should not remain on Irish property. I should, therefore, propose, on some future day, that an arrangement should be made by Parliament, by which, in each succeeding year when the instalment became due, one-half of that instalment should be paid and the other half should be remitted, taking care that the whole debt should be kept up until the half is paid: but when the half was paid the remainder should he remitted to them, providing that one-half of the whole charge shall be refunded. I should state, with regard to the financial part of the question, with regard to the sums hitherto issued, that they have been issued by bills on the Exchequer and the Consolidated Fund, but it neither has been, nor is it now in contemplation to issue Exchequer-bills in order to meet this decrease. But, however, it must be considered when we are making these propositions to Parliament, that it is placing a very considerable burden upon the finances of the country, and that in placing that burden on the finances of this country I do feel myself disabled from making some propositions which I should be called upon to make; and all of them entailing expense, but with the very heavy burden arising from the destitution in the present year, it would be hardly fair for the people of this country to propose them; because, whether it is stated that the burden is borne by the Consolidated Fund, or whether the burden be borne by the imperial Treasury and the general finances, it must always be recollected that these sums are not to be granted by Parliament or the Government without the most serious - consideration, for they are all sums derived from the payment of the people of this country, and who pay it on their soap, their sugar, and their tea and coffee. It is from that source is derived the surplus by which we are enabled to come to the assistance of Ireland. The people are willing, as I think, to do all that is liberal in this respect. We must always consider what is meet and just to the people of this country. We must consider the difficulty and privation, and by what hard labour they earned these sums. With respect to another part of this subject, viz., the advances made under the authority of the Lord-Lieutenant's order, I have here a letter from my Right Hon.

These terms are also to be applied to persons who accepted advances under this Act. These advances I propose shall be repaid, not, as under the former Act, in a period of ten, but in twenty-two years, because I consider that this is a beneficial employment of that money; and I intend, therefore, that the Government should deal with it as with the moneys advanced to the persons I have just referred to. Sir, I have now stated what I think we can do for the present relief of the distress in Ireland. There is, however, another question, to which I must confess somewhat of hesitation in making the proposition I intend to do to the House, but yet, on the whole, we think we are right in recommending to Parliament that we should be enabled to grant a sum of money, not exceeding £50.000, to be repaid before the end of the present year, that is by the 31st of December, 1847, to enable the proprietors to purchase","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

There is, however, another question, to which I must confess somewhat of hesitation in making the proposition I intend to do to the House, but yet, on the whole, we think we are right in recommending to Parliament that we should be enabled to grant a sum of money, not exceeding £50.000, to be repaid before the end of the present year, that is by the 31st of December, 1847, to enable the proprietors to purchase","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"

I think that the misfortune was so severe that, passing by the remote causes of it, we ought not to throw the full burden of it on the possessors of property in Ireland. It would be right that the whole of the burden should not remain on Irish property. I should, therefore, propose, on some future day, that an arrangement should be made by Parliament, by which, in each succeeding year when the instalment became due, one-half of that instalment should be paid and the other half should be remitted, taking care that the whole debt should be kept up until the half is paid: but when the half was paid the remainder should he remitted to them, providing that one-half of the whole charge shall be refunded.

Sir, in stating these measures to the House, I wish, at the same time, to declare that we cannot expect, and we do not expect, to be able, by any measures of Government, or by any measures which Parliament may sanction, to ward off, or prevent, the effect of this awful visitation under which we labour. It is not in the power of man to do away with the effect of such a calamity.

Sir, when I say that we expect this, I am quite sure that by many those duties will be performed, because I know there are many, very ‘many instances of resident proprietors in Ireland, who have been most ready with their money, with their time, and with their attendance, in endeavouring to provide for their destitute tenants.

We say, in the first place, that we think— although we may have been unhappily directed from the observance of general principles with regard to these measures, yet I do think that we should observe these general principles as far as possible, and that they prescribe thus much with regard to the interference of the government—we think that that interference may be given in three ways, and that those three ways ought, as far as possible, to be kept separate and distinct, namely— that Government, with the support and sanction of Parliament, may grant assistance to individuals—to proprietors—for the purpose of improving their private property, to assist in public works, by making loans, or partly by grants for public works, which are of evident public utility; and thirdly, to enact that relief should be given by law to the destitute. I think these three modes ought to be kept as far distinct as possible—that is to say, that when you advance money to a private individual, for the purpose of improving his property, that you should take security so far as this, that it is for that purpose, and not to be spent in extravagance, or for any other purpose—but laid out simply for the purpose for which it is granted, but that beyond that, you should interfere as little as possible with the use of that money.

"O  small holdings are the great evil of Ireland. I do believe that the method on which land has been held, is the chief source of its want of cultivation; but I do not think that the small holdings of the country have been injurious; and I have arrived at that conclusion from the fact, that the most prosperous and best cultivated county in Ireland is Armagh—a county in which the greatest division of land exists. If you compare the whole province of Ulster with that of Munster, you will find that there are many more divisions in the province of Ulster in proportion to that of Munster.

I now come to the third class of measures to which I have alluded are those intended simply to afford relief to the destitute. It will be remembered that when the Poor-law Commission of Inquiry made its report, it advised that only a certain class should be relieved, and in that class it excluded those who were infirm and permanently disabled. We thought, upon the whole, that it was much safer, in the first instance, to have work- houses erected in Ireland, and not to confine the relief to any particular class of men. Sir, it is not only the experience of all those acquainted with the present state of things, but it is our own opinion founded on a general view of the state of Ireland, that the poor-law should be more extensive than it is. I therefore propose to bring in a bill for the purpose of more efficiently meeting the distress in Ireland, which shall confer on the poor-law guardians power to afford relief either in or out of the workhouse to all parties disabled by bodily ailment. This is what we propose in the bill to do; and to give due effect to the measure, in the first place, the guar- dians shall have the power, as a general rule, to use the workhouse as a test of destitution; and in the second place, to afford relief to the starving people at their own houses, in order to satisfy the general feeling of the country on this matter (cheers.) Sir, I also propose, that in cases when the workhouse is full, that the Poor-law Commissioners shall have power to direct the guardians to give relief out of the workhouse to the able-bodied poor. My opinion is, that this power should be cautiously used and that the workhouse, as a general principle, should be employed as a test of able-bodied destitution only; still I think the House will agree with me, that the Poor-law Commissioners should have the power to make alterations in the operation of this test. I propose, therefore, that in cases of urgent necessity—that is, in such cases where the able-bodied make application for relief— that these shall be relieved out of the workhouse, but in food only. We further propose that relieving officers shall be appointed, whose duty it stall be to take cognizance of all cases of distress, and who, in urgent cases, when there is danger of the people starving, shall have the power to give relief out of the workhouse till the next meeting of the board of guardians, such meeting to decide on what arrangement shall be made for the paupers relieved in this manner in future.

"434  of their own property, to increase their capital and improve their estates—we have under consideration measures which shall facilitate the sale of private property (hear, hear). There are two modes by which it is to be done—one mode is, I think, taken from the general principle of the copyhold act. Every one knows that there are private bills passing every year by which certain individuals are allowed to sell a portion of their estates, in order to pay off incumbrances. One way of carrying into effect the principle I have mentioned would be to propose that there should be general bills, giving the commissioners power to examine into each case, and then having the bills passed in another period of the session, by which, instead of one private bill, many private bills would be sanctioned by parliament. Another mode which we have under consideration, by which the same object would be gained could be done by application to the Court of Chancery. I cannot say decidedly at this moment which mode we shall eventually adopt, but we have the subject under our earnest consideration. I shall ""likewise prepare bills by which those tenures in Ireland, which are called long leasehold tenures, renewable for ever, may be converted into freehold tenures. I must say, generally speaking, with regard to the present unfortunate state of Ireland, the most injurious system is the mode in which property is held in various tenures, and under various conditions in that country. The present mode appears to be that of having a small rent charge upon a large estate.

I have not at present any distinct statement to make upon that subject, but I may inform the house that in the course of last autumn three establishments for the manufacture of salt, for the purpose of curing, were founded; there was a vast amount of fish caught, but a much greater amount might have been had were it not that the fisheries were almost utterly neglected for the cultivation of their portions of land.

"If you introduce hundreds of thousands of paupers into your colonies, you will find that the labour market is glutted, and instead of benefiting the colonies, you perpetuate a race of beggars over the country. The consequence would be the crowding of Nova Scotia and Halifax with beggars. In considering this subject when I held the seals of the Colonial office, although I confess I was then disposed to go further than I could go, in consequence of the obstacles in my way, arising from the state of the finances, but I did think that the best mode by which emigration could be promoted was by taking charge of the emigrant, not at his present place of abode, not at the port of his embarkation alone, nor at the port where he disembarked, but conveying him from there to some area where the emigrants might find a market for their labour, accordingly I proposed a certain grant for the purpose of emigration, which has since been continued from time to time, sometimes to a larger and sometimes to a smaller amount. I should certainly be afraid to give anything like a stimulus to emigration, to such an extent as to send a large number of paupers where they could not obtain the means of support, and involving a large outlay and waste of public money. If, under these circumstances, it could not be expected that the State would undertake the whole expenses of an extensive system of emigration, I wish to give no hope of an extensive system of emigration. Sir, I know not if the calculations of Sir B. Kane may be taken altogether as a sober estimate, but he maintains; that there are such resources in Ireland—such agricul- tural resources, independently of the mineral resources of the country; and the means of employment by water power for manufacture—that no less than 17,000,000 of people could be maintained out of them. I do not enter into this calculation; but this I say that I do not think, if there were a good system of agriculture introduced—if there were a good security for investment of money in land—if the proprietors themselves undertook the task of improving the country—if the other classes co-operated with them I do not think the present population of Ireland is excessive (Hear, hear). Sir, I know that what I have touched upon relating to the social state of Ireland—touching as I have done upon many important measures—is but a part of the case.

"The following fact, about the potato plant may not be unimportant at this time of the year. I last year received, direct from the Brazils, two barrels of genuine wild potatoes, small, but very healthy, having been grown in a district where no potato blight has been known. They were planted, about the end of February, in land that had remained in pasture more than twenty years. The situation and soil were favourable; the latter a little stiffish. No dung was used in setting them, but a few decayed leaves and a little sand. Under these circumstances, then, it might be well expected, that if potatoes can escape disease, these would have had a fair chance— wild Brazilian potatoes, planted in England for the first time, in a favourable situation, and in virgin soil.

"As every small farmer should endeavour to imitate the practices of a gardener—for the best managed smail farm is but an approximation to gardening—he should sow as many of the garden vegetables as he conveniently can. Where fresh stable dung can be had, a little hot bed, in the shape of a high potato ridge, should be formed of it, carefully shaken, and closely laid in some sunny place, and covered with fine rich earth about six inches deep, and on it sow a little early York, nonpareil, vanack, or Battersea cabbage seed, covered with half an inch of fine mould; and also a little lettuce of the drumhead, brown Dutch, or Egyptian kinds. These can be sown with the cabbage, and will be fit to transplant out early in April, and fit to cut for pigs, as excellent food, early in June, if planted carefully in a good situation. Few people know the value of these simple and easily-cultivated and quickly matured plants. A few short drills, or a short bed, of mangel-wurzel should be sown this month; and although the plants will start for seed, if allowed to stand over during the summer, yet, if taken up before they start, the root will be found useful to manufacture with wholemeal into bread, whilst the leaves and tops will be found useful for the cow, pig, young turkeys, or young geese.","['early York', None, 'early York, Ireland']","National Centre for Early Music, Percys Lane, Foss Islands, York, England, YO1 9TL, United Kingdom",tourism,53.9566415,-1.0726022038399923,"['53.9564935', '53.9567971', '-1.0730913', '-1.0724026']"

"448  led to hope the cases so dangerously reported are, to say the least of them, a little exaggerated. Nevertheless, too much vigilance cannot be practiced in watching the crop; and as a positive good may proceed from a negative evil, our advice is, to all _ who have potatoes planted, and who are not quite certain of escaping the disease, (as, indeed, few, if any can be,) that immediate steps be taken to secure a crop of some other kind in the same land, whilst there is yet time. This can be done without incurring much expense beyond what would be absolutely necessary to secure a well-grown crop of potatoes in an ordinary season. Let those who have them in lazy- beds (erroneously so called) pulverize the earth well about and between the stalks, removing all weeds, as a matter of course ; let whatever manure that can be procured, whether it be dung, ashes, burnt earth, sea- weed, half decomposed land weeds, bone-dust, guano, or any other simple or compound manure, be placed in a central position between the stalks — the earth pricked up out of the bottoms and sides of the furrows, and shovelled carefully over the entire bed, like "" second spitting;” and as fast as the work proceeds, whilst the earth is fresh and moist, drop three or four grains of Aberdeen or some other good rough-leaved turnip into each space, as already described. The extra expense, in this case, will not be over three or four shillings per acre, including the dropping of the seed, which any little boy or girl can do. The amount of seed required will not exceed |I to 2 Ib. If the potatoes succeed, the turnips, inferior though they may be, will be of much value ; if the potatoes do not succeed, the turnips will be invaluable. So far for beds, and now for drills: — Let them be weeded, and horse and hand hoed immediately, if not already done ; if more manure be desirable, let it be placed between the potato plants ; the earth, when properly pulverized, raised up as if ""landing"" them; and the turnip seed put in, as already directed for beds. The expense of seed and labour, in this case, will be less, and the profits greater than on beds.

"I also planted 3.5 Irish acres of lumper potatoes, in the month of June (last year), for the reproduction of seed. When they were cut down by the disease, the tubers were only of recent formation, and about the size of gooseberries. I immediately dibbled in early field turnip and rape seed, alternately. The turnips were consumed pretty early in winter, and the rape is now approximating to maturity. The young potatoes were very heavily diseased, and putrefactive fermentation and decomposition commenced early, and thinned them very considerably during winter; but a sufficient number retained their vegetable vitality to reproduce a full stock of plants throughout the field. They are now very generally about six inches above the ground. Being overshadowed by the rape, they are too much drawn; but as yet there is no manifestation of disease in any form, or in any part of the plant, either under or above the ground. I expect that the rape will be off the ground by the end of this month, at which time, if the potatoes still give promise of success and justify forbearance, they will have full possession of the ground; and if not, I will immediately plough them up, and re-sow the ground with the green top early field turnip.","['lumper', None, 'lumper, Ireland']","Lumper, Lumperhof, Albertshofen, Ravensburg, Verwaltungsverband Mittleres Schussental, Landkreis Ravensburg, Baden-Württemberg, 88212, Deutschland",road,47.7732325,9.6316117,"['47.7725882', '47.7747514', '9.6293169', '9.6325533']"

"The potato crop may yet prove a failure, flattering although our hopes founded on our own extensive observation, and the much more extensive information derived from every corner of the island. Our wheats now coming so beautifully into ear may be blighted before they arrive at anything like perfection—the same may be said of our oats, barley, bere, and rye—and notwithstanding that nature may have done everything that can render such crops not only prolific, but highly productive, another freak of her's, during the harvest, may falsify all the hopes founded on her summer smiles. Last week we gave some statistics of turnip culture; from all we have since learned we were then under the mark, and we have now some good reason to believe, that before long there will have been sown over 500,000 statute acres of turnips in Ireland.

"Mr. Long read a paper on the disease in the potato. In his paper Mr. Long, who said that he had paid particular attention to the subject, gave it as his opinion that the disease was the consequence of certain noxious influences created by the comet of 1844, and in support of his theory, he referred to the fact that the disease had not only appeared in the following year, 1843, in the potato in the country, but had more or less manifested itself in almost all other vegetables in Europe, America, and all parts of the world.

We calculate this year on being able to raise the principal crop totally in September; and where it is designed to sow oats or barley in spring on the potato land, that we intend planting cabbages in September or October; but where wheat must be sown, we will sow the seed early, and by that means save half, if not three-fourths of the seed usually sown on such land. This we will do, pretty confident of success, encouraged by past experience; and we can now add, that, perhaps, in Great Britain, there are few finer wheat crops than we have, free from disease of every kind, about the cultivation of which there was no mystery, no steeping, no doctoring, beyond a careful selection of the seed, cultivating the","['Great Britain', None, 'Great Britain, Ireland']","Great Britain, United Kingdom",island,54.3151594,-1.9181532111487878,"['49.9586992', '58.6720780', '-6.2278849', '1.7632199']"

Sound cabbages for cattle feeding in an ordinary season, should be worth 50 per cent. more. We saw, also, nonpareil cabbages, now perfectly headed the second time (the first cut last March), and each head, we are satisfied, would average 4 Ibs., exclusive of the loose leaves. Thus, a crop of such cabbages, planted at 2 ft. 7.5 inches asunder between the drills, and 18 inches apart in the drills, at the low weight of 3.5 Ibs. each, the weight per acre would be 28 tons, as a second cutting, in the course of the summer and spring. Who would not plant cabbages and, above all, who would not cultivate green crops by spade husbandry, as is done at Dr. Gregory's and other places we could name? We saw, also, in the fields, some of the finest Swedish turnips we have seen this year, and grown after a crop of winter vetches, and wheat now nearly fit for the sickle, a perfectly healthy crop, standing nearly 7 feet high; and we brought in a bean plant of the Windsor variety, measuring 8 feet high, and well podded. Specimens of all these productions can be seen at our office. We cannot conclude without praising the healthy appearance of this fine establishment for the purposes designed, and offering our honest approval of the excellent manner in which Dr. Gregory's crops are grown, both in the gardens and on the farm, by Mr. Dillon; and in this we are borne out by the opinion of Mr. Tighe, a respectable and intelligent young man, to whom we are indebted for accompanying us to the place.","['Windsor', None, 'Windsor, Ireland']","Windsor, Ontario, N9A 3A8, Canada",city,42.3167397,-83.0373389,"['42.1567397', '42.4767397', '-83.1973389', '-82.8773389']"

"470  many acres of excellent potatoes in Ireland now fit to be dug, as the Irish call the process, or /ifted, as our Scotch friends say, we wish to offer a few words in reply to a series of questions put to us during the last three weeks on the subject. All former practices in this respect we will now look on as comparatively obsolete. Be that as it may, they are too well known to require from us any special remark beyond this, that as many, if not most of them, have proved unsuccessful in preserving the crop, it is useless to advert to them. Altered circumstances require altered modes of action. Whether the tubers this year be at all diseased to a greater or less extent in peculiar situations we are not going to discuss, as all must know how their own crops stand. One thing is quite certain, that if any tubers be diseased, exposure to the action of the atmosphere will hasten that decomposition; and hence the supposition, for it is yet but a supposition, that the tubers kept better in the ground fast year than those taken up and housed or pitted. We would therefore advise all who have potatoes growing on dry land, not designed for the autumn sowing of wheat, to pull off their stalks and cover up the drills or beds, so as to preserve the crops from excessive wet or frosts during the winter months.","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
"Be it observed, that many people lost their potatoes last year by not covering them sufficiently against wet and frosts, so if, in taking the hint we now give, they shall be exposed to the same danger, let them not blame us for it, for we only to advise the covering up, and not immediate digging, where the crop can be secured against frosts and wet, whether the wet proceeds from above or below. To those who require their lands for autumn wheat, or whose lands are wet, we recommend their doing what we are doing, or about to do ourselves —namely, to take up their crops as soon as possible, whilst the weather is dry, the days long, and the sun sufficiently strong to harden the tubers, as they are called. Unripe potatoes require this sunning or greening more than any others; but neither sunning nor anything else can restore to soundness any potatoes at all diseased; and the circumstance of having a few diseased potatoes this year is no proof whatever of the disease of last year being in existence, as we have often seen potatoes, grown on dry lea-land, similarly affected; and the term used in describing the disease we allude to is well known, in parts of the province of Connaught, as ""moss burnt."" We have seen hundreds of barrels of potatoes so affected, in the county of Roscommon, many years ago; and I to such an extent have we seen such crops affected, that the growers left them under ground sooner than that they should become subject to the conacre rent. How little our philosophic botanists know of these things! But to our harvesting. This year an abundance of dry earth, dry sand, dry turf-mould, or other dry material can be had, and should be used, where necessary, amongst the tubers, to keep them from being too much in contact with each other, which would produce fer- mentation, and hasten decomposition. We are preserving all our small potatoes for seed, not that we intend ever again to plant so extensively, even supposing we can keep this year's crop as sound as we could desire, but because we wish to have some to dispose of to those who may have but little, or perhaps none at all. As we take up the crop we separate the large tubers for consumption, and the slightly small ones for seed; badly formed or suspicious small ones we give to the pigs as a rarity with their other food;","['Roscommon', None, 'Roscommon, Ireland']","Roscommon County, Michigan, United States",county,44.3326932,-84.6165164,"['44.1604867', '44.5114400', '-84.8558111', '-84.3663205']"

"[We are much obliged to our correspondent for his communication, notwithstanding there is nothing novel in what he recommends in storing potatoes, as those who have read our pages, must be aware. Whilst there is something rather objectionable as to the time of planting, especially as regards those designed to produce seed. If potato planting ever again becomes general in Ireland, and if it be ever expected to produce as heavy crops, and leave the land in as good tilth, with the least pos- sible expense, as formerly, the best time for planting the general crop will be as formerly, from the middle of April to the 12th of May, as this year has proved it. The best time to plant potatoes to produce seed, is from the middle of May to the middle of June ; but discussions on potato planting are but a waste of time, till we know more of the cause of the disease, by which the crops have been swept off; and even when we will know more of the causes, we may still doubt our power to prevent them, so as to ward off their effects.]","['Ireland', None, 'Ireland, Ireland']",Éire / Ireland,country,52.865196,-7.9794599,"['51.2220000', '55.6360000', '-11.0133788', '-5.6582363']"
